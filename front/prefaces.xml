        <p>To the most high and mightie Prince, James by the grace of God King of Great Britaine,
            France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c. The translators of The Bible, wish
            Grace, Mercie, and Peace, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

        <p>Great and manifold were the blessings (most dread Soveraigne) which Almighty GOD, the
            Father of all Mercies, bestowed upon us the people of ENGLAND, when first he sent your
            Majesties Royall person to rule and raigne over us. For whereas it was the expectation
            of many, who wished not well unto our ZION, that upon the setting of that bright
            Occidentall Starre Queene ELIZABETH of most happy memory, some thicke and palpable
            cloudes of darkenesse would so have overshadowed this land, that men should have bene in
            doubt which way they were to walke, and that it should hardly be knowen, who was to
            direct the unsetled State: the appearance of your MAJESTIE, as of the Sunne in his
            strength, instantly dispelled those supposed and surmised mists, and gave unto all that
            were well affected, exceeding cause of comfort; especially when we beheld the government
            established in your HIGHNESSE, and your hopefull Seed, by an undoubted Title, and this
            also accompanied with Peace and tranquillitie, at home and abroad.</p>

        <p> But amongst all our Joyes, there was no one that more filled our hearts, then the
            blessed continuance of the Preaching of GODS sacred word amongst us, which is that
            inestimable treasure, which excelleth all the riches of the earth, because the fruit
            thereof extendeth it selfe, not onely to the time spent in this transitory world, but
            directeth and disposeth men unto that Eternall happinesse which is above in Heaven.</p>

        <p> Then, not to suffer this to fall to the ground, but rather to take it up, and to
            continue it in that state, wherein the famous predecessour of your HIGHNESSE did leave
            it; Nay, to goe forward with the confidence and resolution of a man in maintaining the
            trueth of CHRIST, and propagating it farre and neere, is that which hath so bound and
            firmely knit the hearts of all your MAJESTIES loyall and Religious people unto you, that
            your very Name is precious among them, their eye doeth behold you with comfort, and they
            blesse you in their hearts, as that sanctified person, who under GOD, is the immediate
            authour of their true happinesse. And this their contentment doeth not diminish or
            decay, but every day increaseth and taketh strength, when they observe that the zeale of
            your Majestie towards the house of GOD, doth not slacke or goe backward, but is more and
            more kindled, manifesting it selfe abroad in the furthest parts of Christendome, by
            writing in defence of the Trueth, (which hath given such a blow unto that man of Sinne,
            as will not be healed) and every day at home, by Religious and learned discourse, by
            frequenting the house of GOD, by hearing the word preached, by cherishing the teachers
            therof, by caring for the Church as a most tender and loving nourcing Father.</p>

        <p> There are infinite arguments of this right Christian and Religious affection in your
            MAJESTIE: but none is more forcible to declare it to others, then the vehement and
            perpetuated desire of the accomplishing and publishing of this Worke, which now with all
            humilitie we present unto your MAJESTIE. For when your Highnesse had once out of deepe
            judgment apprehended, how convenient it was, That out of the Originall sacred tongues,
            together with comparing of the labours, both in our owne and other forreigne Languages,
            of many worthy men who went before us, there should be one more exact Translation of the
            holy Scriptures into the English tongue; your MAJESTIE did never desist, to urge and to
            excite those to whom it was commended, that the worke might be hastened, and that the
            businesse might be expedited in so decent a maner, as a matter of such importance might
            justly require.</p>

        <p> And now at last, by the Mercy of GOD, and the continuance of our Labours, it being
            brought unto such a conclusion, as that we have great hope that the Church of England
            shall reape good fruit thereby; we hold it our duety to offer it to your MAJESTIE, not
            onely as to our King and Soveraigne, but as to the principall moover and Author of the
            Worke. Humbly craving of your most Sacred Majestie, that since things of this quality
            have ever bene subject to the censures of ill meaning and discontented persons, it may
            receive approbation and Patronage from so learned and judicious a Prince as your
            Highnesse is, whose allowance and acceptance of our Labours, shall more honour us and
            incourage us, then all the calumniations and hard interpretations of other men shall
            dismay us. So that, if on the one side we shall be traduced by Popish persons at home or
            abroad, who therefore will maligne us, because we are poore Instruments to make GODS
            holy Trueth to be yet more and more knowen unto the people, whom they desire still to
            keepe in ignorance and darknesse: or if on the other side, we shall be maligned by
            selfe-conceited brethren, who runne their owne wayes, and give liking unto nothing but
            what is framed by themselves, and hammered on their Anvile; we may rest secure,
            supported within by the trueth and innocencie of a good conscience, having walked the
            wayes of simplicitie and integritie, as before the Lord; And sustained without, by the
            powerfull Protection of your Majesties grace and favour, which will ever give
            countenance to honest and Christian endevours, against bitter censures, and uncharitable
            imputations. </p>

        <p> The LORD of Heaven and earth blesse your Majestie with many and happy dayes, that as his
            Heavenly hand hath enriched your Highnesse with many singular, and extraordinary Graces;
            so you may be the wonder of the world in this later age, for happinesse and true
            felicitie, to the honour of that Great GOD, and the good of his Church, through JESUS
            CHRIST our Lord and onely Saviour. </p>

    <div type="preface">
        <head>The Translators to the Reader</head>
        <p>Zeale to promote the common good, whether it be by devising any thing our selves, or
            revising that which hath bene laboured by others, deserveth certainly much respect and
            esteeme, but yet findeth but cold intertainment in the world. It is welcommed with
            suspicion in stead of love, and with emulation in stead of thankes: and if there be any
            hole left for cavill to enter, (and cavill, if it doe not finde a hole, will make one)
            it is sure to bee misconstrued, and in danger to be condemned. This will easily be
            granted by as many as know story, or have any experience. For, was there ever any thing
            projected, that savoured any way of newnesse or renewing, but the same endured many a
            storme of gaine-saying, or opposition? A man would thinke that Civilitie, holesome
            Lawes, learning and eloquence, Synods, and Church-maintenance, (that we speake of no
            more things of this kinde) should be as safe as a Sanctuary, and ll out of shot, as they
            say, that no man would lift up the heele, no, nor dogge moove his tongue against the
            motioners of them. For by the first, we are distinguished from bruit-beasts led with
            sensualitie: By the second, we are bridled and restrained from outragious behaviour, and
            from doing of injuries, whether by fraud or by violence: By the third, we are enabled to
            informe and reforme others, by the light and feeling that we have attained unto our
            selves: Briefly, by the fourth being brought together to a parle face to face, we sooner
            compose our differences then by writings, which are endlesse: And lastly, that the
            Church be sufficiently provided for, is so agreeable to good reason and conscience, that
            those mothers are holden to be lesse cruell, that kill their children assoone as they
            are borne, then those noursing fathers and mothers (wheresoever they be) that withdraw
            from them who hang upon their breasts (and upon whose breasts againe themselves do hang
            to receive the Spirituall and sincere milke of the word) livelyhood and support fit for
            their estates. Thus it is apparent, that these things which we speake of, are of most
            necessary use, and therefore, that none, either without absurditie can speake against
            them, or without note of wickednesse can spurne against them. </p>

        <p> Yet for all that, the learned know that certaine worthy men have bene brought to
            untimely death for none other fault, but for seeking to reduce their Countrey-men to
            good order and discipline: and that in some Common-weales it was made a capitall crime,
            once to motion the making of a new Law for the abrogating of an old, though the same
            were most pernicious: And that certaine, which would be counted pillars of the State,
            and paternes of Vertue and Prudence, could not be brought for a long time to give way to
            good Letters and refined speech, but bare themselves as averse from them, as from rocks
            or boxes of poison: And fourthly, that hee was no babe, but a great clearke, that gave
            foorth (and in writing to remaine to posteritie) in passion peradventure, but yet he
            gave foorth, that hee had not seene any profit to come by any Synode, or meeting of the
            Clergie, but rather the contrary: And lastly, against Church-maintenance and allowance,
            in such sort, as the Embassadors and messengers of the great King of Kings should be
            furnished, it is not unknowen what a fiction or fable (so it is esteemed, and for no
            better by the reporter himselfe, though superstitious) was devised; Namely, that at such
            time as the professours and teachers of Christianitie in the Church of Rome, then a true
            Church, were liberally endowed, a voyce forsooth was heard from heaven, saying; Now is
            poison poured down into the Church, &amp;c. Thus not only as oft as we speake, as one
            saith, but also as oft as we do any thing of note or consequence, we subject our selves
            to every ones censure, and happy is he that is least tossed upon tongues; for utterly to
            escape the snatch of them it is impossible. If any man conceit, that this is the lot and
            portion of the meaner sort onely, and that Princes are priviledged by their high estate,
            he is deceived. As the sword devoureth aswell one as the other, as it is in Samuel; nay
            as the great Commander charged his souldiers in a certaine battell, to strike at no part
            of the enemie, but at the face; And as the King of Syria commanded his chiefe Captaines
            to fight neither with small nor great, save onely against the King of Israel: so it is
            too true, that Envie striketh most spitefully at the fairest, and at the chiefest. David
            was a worthy Prince, and no man to be compared to him for his first deedes, and yet for
            as worthy an acte as ever he did (even for bringing backe the Arke of God in solemnitie)
            he was scorned and scoffed at by his owne wife. Solomon was greater then David, though
            not in vertue, yet in power: and by his power and wisdome he built a Temple to the LORD,
            such a one was the glory of the land of Israel, and the wonder of the whole world. But
            was that his magnificence liked of by all? We doubt of it. Otherwise, why doe they lay
            it in his sonnes dish, and call unto him for ll easing of the burden, Make, say they,
            the grievous servitude of thy father, and his sore yoke, lighter. Belike he had charged
            them with some levies, and troubled them with some cariages; Hereupon they raise up a
            tragedie, and wish in their heart the Temple had never bene built. So hard a thing it is
            to please all, even when we please God best, and doe seeke to approve our selves to
            every ones conscience. </p>

        <p> If wee will descend to later times, wee shall finde many the like examples of such kind,
            or rather unkind acceptance. The first Romane Emperour did never doe a more pleasing
            deed to the learned, nor more profitable to posteritie, for conserving the record of
            times in true supputation; then when he corrected the Calender, and ordered the yeere
            according to the course of the Sunne: and yet this was imputed to him for noveltie, and
            arrogancie, and procured to him great obloquie. So the first Christened Emperour (at the
            leastwise that openly professed the faith himselfe, and allowed others to doe the like)
            for strengthening the Empire at his great charges, and providing for the Church, as he
            did, got for his labour the name Pupillus, as who would say, a wastefull Prince, that
            had neede of a Guardian, or overseer. So the best Christened Emperour, for the love that
            he bare unto peace, thereby to enrich both himselfe and his subjects, and because he did
            not seeke warre but find it, was judged to be no man at armes, (though in deed he
            excelled in feates of chivalrie, and shewed so much when he was provoked) and condemned
            for giving himselfe to his ease, and to his pleasure. To be short, the most learned
            Emperour of former times, (at the least, the greatest politician) what thanks had he for
            cutting off the superfluities of the lawes, and digesting them into some order and
            method? This, that he hath been blotted by some to bee an Epitomist, that is, one that
            extinguished worthy whole volumes, to bring his abridgements into request. This is the
            measure that hath been rendred to excellent Princes in former times, even, Cum benè
            facerent, malè audire, For their good deedes to be evill spoken of. Neither is there any
            likelihood, that envie and malignitie died, and were buried with the ancient. No, no,
            the reproofe of Moses taketh hold of most ages; You are risen up in your fathers stead,
            an increase of sinfull men. What is that that hath been done? that which shall be done:
            and there is no new thing under the Sunne, saith the wiseman: and S. Steven, As your
            fathers did, so doe you. This, and more to this purpose, His Majestie that now reigneth
            (and long, and long may he reigne, and his offspring for ever, Himselfe and children,
            and childrens children alwayes) knew full well, according to the singular wisdome given
            unto him by God, and the rare learning and experience that he hath attained unto; namely
            that whosoever attempteth any thing for the publike (specially if it pertaine to
            Religion, and to the opening and clearing of the word of God) the same setteth himselfe
            upon a stage to be glouted upon by every evil eye, yea, he casteth himselfe headlong
            upon pikes, to be gored by every sharpe tongue. For he that medleth with mens Religion
            in any part, medleth with their custome, nay, with their freehold; and though they finde
            no content in that which they have, yet they cannot abide to heare of altering.
            Notwithstanding his Royall heart was not daunted or discouraged for this or that colour,
            but stood resolute, as a statue immoveable, and an anvile not easie to be beaten into
            plates, as one sayth; he knew who had chosen him to be a Souldier, or rather a Captaine,
            and being assured that the course which he intended made much for the glory of God,
            &amp; the building up of his Church, he would not suffer it to be broken off for
            whatsoever speaches or practises. It doth certainely belong unto Kings, yea, it doth
            specially belong unto them, to have care of Religion, yea, to know it aright, yea, to
            professe it zealously, yea to promote it to the uttermost of their power. This is their
            glory before all nations which meane well, and this will bring unto them a farre most
            excellent weight of glory in the day of the Lord Jesus. For the Scripture saith not in
            vaine, Them that honor me, I will honor, neither was it a vaine word that Eusebius
            delivered long agoe, that pietie towards God was the weapon, and the onely weapon that
            both preserved Constantines person, and avenged him of his enemies. </p>

        <p> But now what pietie without trueth? what trueth (what saving trueth) without the word of
            God? what word of God (whereof we may be sure) without the Scripture? The Scriptures we
            are commanded to search. Joh. 5.39. Esa. 8.20. They are commended that searched &amp;
            studied them. Act. 17.11. and 8.28, 29. They are reproved that were unskilful in them,
            or slow to beleeve them. Mat. 22.29. Luk. 24.25. They can make us wise unto salvation.
            2. Tim. 3.15. If we be ignorant, they will instruct us; if out of the way, they will
            bring us home; if out of order, they will reforme us, if in heavines, comfort us; if
            dull, quicken us; if colde, inflame us. Tolle, lege; Tolle, lege, Take up and read, take
            up and read the Scriptures, (for unto them was the direction) it was said unto S.
            Augustine by a supernaturall voyce. Whatsoevar is in the Scriptures, beleeve me, saith
            the same S. Augustine, is high and divine; there is verily trueth, and a doctrine most
            fit for the refreshing and renewing of mens mindes, and truely so tempered, that every
            one may draw from thence that which is sufficient for him, if hee come to draw with a
            devout and pious minde, as true Religion requireth. Thus S. Augustine. And S. Jerome:
            Ana scripturas, &amp; amabit te sapientia &amp;c. Love the Scriptures, and wisedome will
            love thee. And S. Cyrill against Julian; Even boyes that are bred up in the Scriptures,
            become most religious, &amp;c. But what mention wee three or foure uses of the
            Scripture, whereas whatsoever is to be beleeved or practised, or hoped for, is contained
            in them? or three or foure sentences of the Fathers, since whosoever is worthy of the
            name of a Father, from Christs time downeward, hath likewise written not onely of the
            riches, but also of the perfection of the Scripture? I adore the fulnesse of the
            Scripture, saith Tertullian against Hermogenes. And againe, to Apelles an Heretike of
            the like stampe, he saith; I doe not admit that which thou bringest in (or concludest)
            of thine owne (head or store, de tuo) without Scripture. So Saint Justin Martyr before
            him; Wee must know by all meanes, saith hee, that it is not lawfull (or possible) to
            learne (any thing) of God or of right pietie, save onely out of the Prophets, who teach
            us by divine inspiration. So Saint Basill after Tertullian, It is a manifest falling
            away from the Faith, and a fault of presumption, either to reject any of those things
            that are written, or to bring in (upon the head of them, ) any of those things that are
            not written. Wee omit to cite to the same effect, S. Cyrill B. of Jerusalem in his 4.
            Cataches. Saint Jerome against Heludius, Saint Augustine in his 3. booke against the
            letters of Petilian, and in very many other places of his workes. Also we forebeare to
            descend to latter Fathers, because wee will not wearie the reader. The Scriptures then
            being acknowledged to bee so full and so perfect, how can wee excuse our selves of
            negligence, if we doe not studie them, of curiositie, if we be not content with them?
            Men talke much of , how many sweete and goodly things it had hanging on it; of the
            Philosphers stone, that it turneth copper into gold; of Cornu-copia, that it had all
            things necessary for foode in it; of Panaces the herbe, that it was good for all
            diseases; of Catholicon the drugge, that is in stead of all purges; of Vulcans armour,
            that is was an armour of proofe against all thrusts, and all blowes, &amp;c. Well, that
            which they falsly or vainely attributed to these things for bodily good, wee may justly
            and with full measure ascribe unto the Scripture, for spirituall. It is not onely an
            armour, but also a whole armorie of weapons, both offensive, and defensive; whereby we
            may save our selves and put the enemie to flight. It is not an herbe, but a tree, or
            rather a whole paradise of trees of life, which bring foorth fruit every moneth, and the
            fruit thereof is for meate, and the leaves for medicine. It is not a pot of Manna, or a
            cruse of oyle, which were for memorie only, or for a meales meate or two, but as it were
            a showre of heavenly bread sufficient for a whole host, be it never so great; and as it
            were a whole cellar full of oyle vessels; whereby all our necessities may be provided
            for, and our debts discharged. In a word, it is a Panary of holesome foode, against
            fenowed traditions; a Physions-shop (Saint Basill calleth it) of preservatives against
            poisoned heresies; a Pandect of profitable lawes, against rebellious spirits; a
            treasurie of most costly jewels, against beggarly rudiments; Finally a fountaine of most
            pure water springing up unto everlasting life. And what marvaile? The originall thereof
            being from heaven, not from earth; the authour being God, not man; the enditer, the holy
            spirit, not the wit of the Apostles or Prophets; the Pen-men such as were sanctified
            from the wombe, and endewed with a principall portion of Gods spirit; the matter,
            veritie, pietie, puritie, uprightnesse; the forme, Gods word, Gods testimonie, Gods
            oracles, the word of trueth, the word of salvation, &amp;c. the effects, light of
            understanding, stablenesse of persuasion, repentance from dead workes, newnesse of life,
            holinesse, peace, joy in the holy Ghost; lastly, the end and reward of the studie
            thereof, fellowship with the Saints, participation of the heavenly nature, fruition of
            an inheritance immortall, undefiled, and that never shall fade away: Happie is the man
            that delighteth in the Scripture, and thrise happie that meditateth in it day and night. </p>

        <p> But how shall men meditate in that, which they cannot understand? How shall they
            understand that which is kept close in an unknowen tongue? as it is written, Except I
            know the power of the voyce, I shall be to him that speaketh, a Barbarian, and he that
            speaketh, shalbe a Barbarian to me. The Apostle excepteth no tongue, not Hebrewe the
            ancientest, not Greeke the most copious, not Latine the finest. Nature taught a naturall
            man to confesse, that all of us in those tongues which wee doe not understand, are
            plainely deafe; wee may turne the deafe eare unto them. The Scythian counted the
            Athenian, whom he did not understand, barbarous: so the Romane did the Syrian, and the
            Jew, (even S. Jerome himselfe calleth the Hebrew tongue barbarous, belike because it was
            strange to so many) so the Emperour of Constantinople calleth the Latine tongue,
            barbarous, though Pope Nicolas do storme at it: so the Jewes long before Christ, called
            all other nations, Lognazim, which is little better then barbarous. Therefore as one
            complaineth, that alwayes in the Senate of Rome, there was one or other that called for
            an interpreter: so lest the Church be driven to the like exigent, it is necessary to
            have translations in a readinesse. Translation it is that openeth the window, to let in
            the light; that breaketh the shell, that we may eat the kernel; that putteth aside the
            curtaine, that we may looke into the most Holy place; that remooveth the cover of the
            well, that wee may come by the water, even as Jacob rolled away the stone from the mouth
            of the well, by which meanes the flockes of Laban were watered. Indeede without
            translation into the vulgar tongue, the unlearned are but like children at Jacobs well
            (which was deepe) without a bucket or some thing to draw with: or as that person
            mentioned by Esau, to whom when a sealed booke was delivered, with this motion, Reade
            this, I pray thee, hee was faine to make this answere, I cannot, for it is sealed. </p>

        <p> While God would be knowen onely in Jacob, and have his Name great in Israel, and in none
            other place, while the dew lay on Gideons fleece onely, and all the earth besides was
            drie; then for one and the same people, which spake all of them the language of Canaan,
            that is, Hebrewe, one and the same originall in Hebrew was sufficient. But when the
            fulnesse of time drew neere, that the Sunne of righteousnesse, the Sonne of God should
            come into the world, whom God ordeined to be a reconciliation through faith in his
            blood, not of the Jew onely, but also of the Greeke, yea, of all them that were
            scattered abroad; then loe, it pleased the Lord to stirre up the spirit of a Greeke
            Prince (Greeke for descent and language) even of Ptolome Philadelph King of Egypt, to
            procure the translating of the Booke of God out of Hebrew into Greeke. This is the
            translation of the Seventie Interpreters, commonly so called, which prepared the way for
            our Saviour among the Gentiles by written preaching, as Saint John Baptist did among the
            Jewes by vocall. For the Grecians being desirous of learning, were not wont to suffer
            bookes of worth to lye moulding in Kings Libraries, but had many of their servants,
            ready scribes, to copie them out, and so they were dispersed and made common. Againe,
            the Greeke tongue was wellknowen and made familiar to most inhabitants in Asia, by
            reason of the conquest that there the Grecians had made, as also by the Colonies, which
            thither they had sent. For the same causes also it was well understood in many places of
            Europe, yea, and of Affrike too. Therefore the word of God being set foorth in Greeke,
            becommeth hereby like a candle set upon a candlesticke, which giveth light to all that
            are in the house, or like a proclamation sounded foorth in the market place, which most
            men presently take knowledge of; and therefore that language was fittest to containe the
            Scriptures, both for the first Preachers of the Gospel to appeale unto for witnesse, and
            for the learners also of those times to make search and triall by. It is certaine, that
            the Translation was not so sound and so perfect, but that it needed in many places
            correction; and who had bene so sufficient for this worke as the Apostles or Apostolike
            men? Yet it seemed good to the holy Ghost and to them, to take that which they found,
            (the same being for the greatest part true and sufficient) rather then by making a new,
            in that new world and greene age of the Church, to expose themselves to many exceptions
            and cavillations, as though they made a Translation to serve their owne turne, and
            therefore bearing witnesse to themselves, their witnesse not to be regarded. This may be
            supposed to bee some cause, why the Translation of the Seventie was allowed to passe for
            currant. Notwithstanding, though it was commended generally, yet it did not fully
            content the learned, no not of the Jewes. For not long after Christ, Aquila fell in hand
            with a new Translation, and after him Theodotion, and after him Symmachus: yea, there
            was a fift and a sixt edition the Authours wherof were not knowen. These with the
            Seventie made up the Hexapla, and were worthily and to great purpose compiled together
            by Origen. Howbeit the Edition of the Seventie went away with the credit, and therefore
            not onely was placed in the midst by Origen (for the worth and excellencie thereof above
            the rest, as Epiphanius gathereth) but also was used by the Greeke fathers for the
            ground and foundation of their Commentaries. Yea, Epiphanius above named doeth attribute
            so much unto it, that he holdeth the Authours thereof not onely for Interpreters, but
            also for Prophets in some respect: and Justinian the Emperour enjoyning the Jewes his
            subjects to use specially the Translation of the Seventie, rendreth this reason thereof,
            because they were as it were enlighted with propheticall grace. Yet for all that, as the
            Egyptians are said of the Prophet to bee men and not God, and their horses flesh and not
            spirit: so it is evident, (and Saint Jerome affirmeth as much) that the Seventie were
            Interpreters, they were not Prophets; they did many things well, as learned men; but yet
            as men they stumbled and fell, one while through oversight, another while through
            ignorance, yea, sometimes they may be noted to adde to the Originall, and sometimes to
            take from it; which made the Apostles to leave them many times, when they left the
            Hebrew, and to deliver the sence thereof according to the trueth of the word, as the
            spirit gave them utterance. This may suffice touching the Greeke Translations of the old
            Testament. </p>

        <p> There were also within a few hundreth yeeres after CHRIST, translations many into the
            Latine tongue: for this tongue also was very fit to convey the Law and the Gospel by,
            because in those times very many Countreys of the West, yea of the South, East and
            North, spake or understood Latine, being made Provinces to the Romanes. But now the
            Latine Translations were too many to be all good, for they were infinite (Latini
            Interpretes nullo modo numerari possunt, saith S. Augustine.) Againe they were not out
            of the Hebrew fountaine (wee speake of the Latine Translations of the Old Testament) but
            out of the Greeke streame, therefore the Greeke being not altogether cleare, the Latine
            derived from it must needs be muddie. This moved S. Jerome a most learned father, and
            the best linguist without controversie, of his age, or of any that went before him, to
            undertake the translating of the Old Testament, out of the very fountaines themselves;
            which hee performed with that evidence of great learning, judgement, industrie and
            faithfulnes, that he hath for ever bound the Church unto him, in a debt of speciall
            remembrance and thankefulnesse. </p>

        <p> Now though the Church were thus furnished with Greeke and Latine Translations, even
            before the faith of CHRIST was generally embraced in the Empire: (for the learned know
            that even in S. Jeroms time, the Consul of Rome and his wife were both Ethnicks, and
            about the same time the greatest part of the Senate also) yet for all that the
            godly-learned were not content to have the Scriptures in the Language which themselves
            understood, Greeke and Latine, (as the good Lepers were not content to fare well
            themselves, but acquainted their neighbours with the store that God had sent, that they
            also might provide for themselves) but also for the behoofe and edifying of the
            unlearned which hungred and thirsted after Righteousnesse, and had soules to be saved as
            well as they, they provided Translations into the vulgar for their Countreymen, insomuch
            that most nations under heaven did shortly after their conversion, heare CHRIST speaking
            unto them in their mother tongue, not by the voyce of their Minister onely, but also by
            the written word translated. If any doubt hereof, he may be satisfied by examples
            enough, if enough will serve the turne. First S. Jerome saith, Multarum gentiu linguis
            Scriptura antè translata, docet falsa esse quæ addita sunt, &amp;c.i. The Scripture
            being translated before in the languages of many Nations, doth shew that those things
            that were added (by Lucian or Hesychius) are false. So S. Jerome in that place. The same
            Jerome elsewhere affirmeth that he, the time was, had set forth the translation of the
            Seventy, suæ linguæ hominibus.i. for his countreymen of Dalmatia. Which words not only
            Erasmus doth understand to purport, that S. Jerome translated the Scripture into the
            Dalmatian tongue, but also Sixtus Senensis, and Alphonsus à Castro (that we speake of no
            more) men not to be excepted against by them of Rome, doe ingenuously confesse as much.
            So, S. Chrysostome that lived in S. Hieromes time, giveth evidence with him: The
            doctrine of S. John (saith he) did not in such sort (as the Philosophers did) vanish
            away: but the Syrians, Egyptians, Indians, Persians. Ethiopians, and infinite other
            nations being barbarous people, translated it into their (mother) tongue, and have
            learned to be (true) Philosophers, he meaneth Christians. To this may be added
            Theodorit, as next unto him, both for antiquitie, and for learning. His words be these,
            Every Countrey that is under the Sunne, is full of these wordes (of the Apostles and
            Prophets) and the Hebrew tongue (he meaneth the Scriptures in the Hebrew tongue) is
            turned not onely into the Language of the Grecians, but also of the Romanes, and
            Egyptians, and Persians, and Indians, and Armenians, and Scythians, and Sauromatians,
            and briefly into all the Languages that any Nation useth. So he. In like maner, Ulpilas
            is reported by Paulus Diaconus and Isidor (and before them by Sozomen) to have
            translated the Scriptures into the Gothicke tongue: John Bishop of Sivil by Vasseus, to
            have turned them into Arabicke, about the yeere of our Lord 717: Beda by Cistertiensis,
            to have turned a great part of them into Saxon: Efnard by Trithemius, to have abridged
            the French Psalter, as Beda had done the Hebrew, about the yeere 800: King Alured by the
            said Cistertiensis, to have turned the Psalter into Saxon: Methodius by Aventinus
            (printed at Ingolstad) to have turned the Scriptures into ll Sclavonian: Valdo, Bishop
            of Frising by Beatus Rhenanus, to have caused about that time, the Gospels to be
            translated into Dutch-rithme, yet extant in the Library of Corbinian: Valdus, by divers
            to have turned them himselfe, or to have gotten them turned into French, about the yeere
            1160: Charles the 5. of that name, surnamed The wise, to have caused them to be turned
            into French, about 200. yeeres after Valdus his time, of which translation there be many
            copies yet extant, as witnesseth Beroaldus. Much about that time, even in our King
            Richard the seconds dayes, John Trevisa translated them into English, and many English
            Bibles in written hand are yet to be seene with divers, translated as it is very
            probable, in that age. So the Syrian translation of the New Testament is in most learned
            mens Libraries, of Widminstadius his setting forth, and the Psalter in Arabicke is with
            many, of Augustinus Nebiensis setting foorth. So Postel affirmeth, that in his travaile
            he saw the Gospels in the Ethiopian tongue; And Ambrose Thesius alleageth the Psalter of
            the Indians, which he testifieth to have bene set forth by Potken in Syrian characters.
            So that, to have the Scriptures in the mother-tongue is not a quaint conceit lately
            taken up, either by the Lord Cromwell in England, or by the Lord Radevil in Polonie, or
            by the Lord Ungnadius in the Emperours dominion, but hath bene thought upon, and put in
            practise of old, even from the first times of the conversion of any Nation; no doubt,
            because it was esteemed most profitable, to cause faith to grown in mens hearts the
            sooner, and to make them to be able to say with the words of the Psalme, As we have
            heard, so we have seene. </p>

        <p> Now the Church of Rome would seeme at the length to beare a motherly affection towards
            her children, and to allow them the Scriptures in their mother tongue: but indeed it is
            a gift, not deserving to be called a gift, an unprofitable gift: they must first get a
            Licence in writing before they may use them, and to get that, they must approve
            themselves to their Confessor, that is, to be such as are, if not frozen in the dregs,
            yet soured with the leaven of their superstition. Howbeit, it seemed too much to Clement
            the 8. that there should be any Licence granted to have them in the vulgar tongue, and
            therefore he overruleth and frustrateth the grant of Pius the fourth. So much are they
            afraid of the light of the Scripture, (Lucifugæ Scripturarum, as Tertullian speaketh)
            that they will not trust the people with it, no not as it is set foorth by their owne
            sworne men, no not with the Licence of their owne Bishops and Inquisitors. Yea, so
            unwilling they are to communicate the Scriptures to the peoples understanding in any
            sort, that they are not ashamed to confesse, that wee forced them to translate it into
            English against their wills. This seemeth to argue a bad cause, or a bad conscience, or
            both. Sure we are, that it is not he that hath good gold, that is afraid to bring it to
            the touch-stone, but he that hath the counterfeit; neither is it the true man that
            shunneth the light, but the malefactour, lest his deedes should be reproved: neither is
            it the plaine dealing Merchant that is unwilling to have the waights, or the meteyard
            brought in place, but he that useth deceit. But we will let them alone for this fault,
            and returne to translation. </p>

        <p> Many mens mouths have bene open a good while (and yet are not stopped) with speeches
            about the Translation so long in hand, or rather perusals of Translations made before:
            and aske what may be the reason, what the necessitie of the employment: Hath the Church
            bene deceived, say they, all this while? Hath her sweet bread bene mingled with leaven,
            her silver with drosse, her wine with water, her milke with lime? (Lacte gypsum malè
            miscetur, saith S. Ireney,) We hoped that we had bene in the right way, that we had had
            the Oracles of God delivered unto us, and that though all the world had cause to be
            offended and to complaine, yet that we had none. Hath the nurse holden out the breast,
            and nothing but winde in it? Hath the bread bene delivered by the fathers of the Church,
            and the same proved to be lapidosus, as Seneca speaketh? What is it to handle the word
            of God deceitfully, if this be not? Thus certaine brethren. Also the adversaries of
            Judah and Jerusalem, like Sanballat in Nehemiah, mocke, as we heare, both at the worke
            and workemen, saying; What doe these weake Jewes, &amp;c. will they make the stones
            whole againe out of the heapes of dust which are burnt? although they build, yet if a
            foxe goe up, he shall even breake downe their stony wall. Was their Translation good
            before? Why doe they now mend it? Was it not good? Why then was it obtruded to the
            people? Yea, why did the Catholicks (meaning Popish Romanists) alwayes goe in jeopardie,
            for refusing to goe to heare it? Nay, if it must be translated into English, Catholicks
            are fittest to doe it. They have learning, and they know when a thing is well, they can
            manum de tabulá. Wee will answere them both briefly: and the former, being brethren,
            thus, with S. Jerome, Damnamus veteres? Minimè, sed post priorum studia in domo Domini
            quod possumus laboramus. That is, Doe we condemne the ancient? In no case: but after the
            endevours of them that were before us, wee take the best paines we can in the house of
            God. As if hee said, Being provoked by the example of the learned that lived before my
            time, I have thought it my duetie, to assay whether my talent in the knowledge of the
            tongues, may be profitable in any measure to Gods Church, lest I should seeme to have
            laboured in them in vaine, and lest I should be thought to glory in men, (although
            ancient,) above that which was in them. Thus S. Jerome may be thought to speake. </p>

        <p> And to the same effect say wee, that we are so farre off from condemning any of their
            labours that traveiled before us in this kinde, either in this land or beyond sea,
            either in King Henries time, or King Edwards (if there were any translation, or
            correction of a translation in his time) or Queene Elizabeths of ever-renoumed memorie,
            that we acknowledge them to have beene raised up of God, for the building and furnishing
            of his Church, and that they deserve to be had of us and of posteritie in everlasting
            remembrance. The Judgement of Aristotle is worthy and well knowen: If Timotheus had not
            bene, we had not had much sweet musicke; but if Phrynis (Timotheus his master) had not
            beene, wee had not had Timotheus. Therefore blessed be they, and most honoured be their
            name, that breake the ice, and glueth onset upon that which helpeth forward to the
            saving of soules. Now what can bee more availeable thereto, then to deliever Gods booke
            unto Gods people in a tongue which they understand? Since of an hidden treasure, and of
            a fountaine that is sealed, there is no profit, as Ptolomee Philadelph wrote to the
            Rabbins or masters of the Jewes, as witnesseth Epiphanius: and as S. Augustine saith; A
            man had rather be with his dog then with a stranger (whose tongue is strange unto him.)
            Yet for all that, as nothing is begun and perfited at the same time, and the later
            thoughts are thought to be the wiser: so, if we building upon their foundation that went
            before us, and being holpen by their labours, doe endevour to make that better which
            they left so good; no man, we are sure, hath cause to mislike us; they, we persuade our
            selves, if they were alive, would thanke us. The vintage of Abiezer, that strake the
            stroake: yet the gleaning of grapes of Ephraim was not to be despised. See Judges 8.
            verse 2. Joash the king of Israel did not satisfie himselfe, till he had smitten the
            ground three times; and yet hee offended the Prophet, for giving over then. Aquila, of
            whom wee spake before, translated the Bible as carefully, and as skilfully as he could;
            and yet he thought good to goe over it againe, and then it got the credit with the
            Jewes, to be called , that is accuratly done, as Saint Jerome witnesseth. How many
            bookes of profane learning have bene gone over againe and againe, by the same
            translators, by others? Of one and the same booke of Aristotles Ethikes, there are
            extant not so few as sixe or seven severall translations. Now if this cost may bee
            bestowed upon the goord, which affordeth us a little shade, and which to day
            flourisheth, but to morrow is cut downe; what may we bestow, nay what ought we not to
            bestow upon the Vine, the fruite whereof maketh glad the conscience of man, and the
            stemme whereof abideth for ever? And this is the word of God, which we translate. What
            is the chaffe to the wheat, saith the Lord? Tanti vitreum, quanti verum margaritum
            (saith Tertullian,) if a toy of glasse be of that rekoning with us, how ought wee to
            value the true pearle? Therefore let no mans eye be evill, because his Majesties is
            good; neither let any be grieved, that wee have a Prince that seeketh the increase of
            the spirituall wealth of Israel (let Sanballats and Tobiahs doe so, which therefore doe
            beare their just reproofe) but let us rather blesse God from the ground of our heart,
            for working this religious care in him, to have the translations of the Bible maturely
            considered of and examined. For by this meanes it commeth to passe, that whatsoever is
            sound alreadie (and all is sound for substance, in one or other of our editions, and the
            worst of ours farre better then their autentike vulgar) the same will shine as gold more
            brightly, being rubbed and polished; also if any thing be halting, or superfluous, or
            not so agreeable to the originall, the same may bee corrected, and the trueth set in
            place. And what can the King command to bee done, that will bring him more true honour
            then this? and wherein could they that have beene set a worke, approve their duetie to
            the King, yea their obedience to God, and love to his Saints more, then by yeelding
            their service, and all that is within them, for the furnishing of the worke? But besides
            all this, they were the principall motives of it, and therefore ought least to quarrell
            it: for the very Historicall trueth is, that upon the importunate petitions of the
            Puritanes, at this Majesties comming to this Crowne, the Conference at Hampton Court
            having bene appointed for hearing their complaints: when by force of reason they were
            put from all other grounds, they had recourse at the last, to this shift, that they
            could not with good conscience subscribe to the Communion booke, since it maintained the
            Bible as it was there translated, which was as they said, a most corrupted translation.
            And although this was judged to be but a very poore and emptie shift; yet even hereupon
            did his Majestie beginne to bethinke himselfe of the good that might ensue by a new
            translation, and presently after gave order for this Translation which is now presented
            unto thee. Thus much to satisfie our scrupulous Brethren. </p>

        <p> Now to the later we answere; that wee doe not deny, nay wee affirme and avow, that the
            very meanest translation of the Bible in English, set foorth by men of our profession
            (for wee have seene none of theirs of the whole Bible as yet) containeth the word of
            God, nay, is the word of God. As the Kings Speech which hee uttered in Parliament, being
            translated into French, Dutch, Italian and Latine, is still the Kings Speech, though it
            be not interpreted by every Translator with the like grace, nor peradventure so fitly
            for phrase, nor so expresly for sence, every where. For it is confessed, that things are
            to take their denomination of the greater part; and a naturall man could say, Verùm ubi
            multa nitent in carmine, non ego paucis offendor maculis, &amp;c. A man may be counted a
            vertuous man, though hee have made many slips in his life, (els, there were none
            vertuous, for in many things we offend all) also a comely man and lovely, though hee
            have some warts upon his hand, yea, not onely freakles upon his face, but all skarres.
            No cause therefore why the word translated should bee denied to be the word, or
            forbidden to be currant, notwithstanding that some imperfections and blemishes may be
            noted in the setting foorth of it. For what ever was perfect under the Sunne, where
            Apostles or Apostolike men, that is, men indued with an extraordinary measure of Gods
            spirit, and priviledged with the priviledge of infallibilitie, had not their hand? The
            Romanistes therefore in refusing to heare, and daring to burne the Word translated, did
            no lesse then despite the spirit of grace, from whom originally it proceeded, and whose
            sense and meaning, as well as mans weaknesse would enable, it did expresse. Judge by an
            example or two. Plutarch writeth, that after that Rome had beene burnt by the Galles,
            they fell soone to builde it againe: but doing it in haste, they did not cast the
            streets, nor proportion the houses in such comely fashion, as had bene most sightly and
            convenient; was Catiline therefore an honest man, or a good Patriot, that sought to
            bring it to a combustion? or Nero a good Prince, that did indeed set it on fire? So, by
            the story of Ezrah, and the prophesie of Haggai it may be gathered, that the Temple
            build by Zerubbabel after the returne from Babylon, was by no meanes to bee compared to
            the former built by Solomon (for they that remembred the former, wept when they
            considered the latter) notwithstanding, might this later either have bene abhorred and
            forsaken by the Jewes, or prophaned by the Greekes? The like wee are to thinke of
            Translations. The translation of the Seventie dissenteth from the Originall in many
            places, neither doeth it come neere it, for perspicuitie, gratvitie, majestie; yet which
            of the Apostles did condemne it? Condemne it? Nay, they used it, (as it is apparent, and
            as Saint Jerome and most learned men doe confesse) which they would not have done, nor
            by their example of using it, so grace and commend it to the Church, if it had bene
            unworthy the appellation and name of the word of God. And whereas they urge for their
            second defence of their vilifying and abusing of the English Bibles, or some pieces
            thereof, which they meete with, for that heretikes (forsooth) were the Authours of the
            translations, (heretikes they call us by the same right that they call themselves
            Catholikes, both being wrong) wee marveile what divinitie taught them so. Wee are sure
            Tertullian was of another minde: Ex personis probamus fidem, an ex fide personas? Doe we
            trie mens faith by their persons? we should trie their persons by their faith. Also S.
            Augustine was of an other minde: for he lighting upon certaine rules made by Tychonius a
            Donatist, for the better understanding of the word, was not ashamed to make use of them,
            yea, to insert them into his owne booke, with giving commendation to them so farre
            foorth as they were worthy to be commended, as is to be seene in S. Augustines third
            booke De doctrinâ Christianâ. To be short, Origen, and the whole Church of God for
            certain hundred yeeres, were of an other minde: for they were so farre from treading
            under foote, (much more from burning) the Translation of Aquila a Proselite, that is,
            one that had turned Jew; of Symmachus, and Theodotion, both Ebionites, that is, most
            vile heretikes, that they joyned them together with the Hebrew Originall, and the
            Translation of the Seventie (as hath bene before signified out of Epiphanius) and set
            them forth openly to be considered of and perused by all. But we weary the unlearned,
            who need not know so much, and trouble the learned, who know it already. </p>

        <p> Yet before we end, we must answere a third cavill and objection of theirs against us,
            for altering and amending our Taanslations [sic] so oft; wherein truely they deale
            hardly, and strangely with us. For to whom ever was it imputed for a fault (by such as
            were wise) to goe over that which hee had done, and to amend it where he saw cause?
            Saint Augustine was not afraide to exhort S. Jerome to a Palinodia or recantation; the
            same S. Augustine was not ashamed to retractate, we might say revoke, many things that
            had passed him, and doth even glory that he seeth his infirmities. If we will be sonnes
            of the Trueth, we must consider what it speaketh, and trample upon our owne credit, yea,
            and upon other mens too, if either be any way an hinderance to it. This to the cause:
            then to the persons we say, that of all men they ought to bee most silent in this case.
            For what varieties have they, and what alterations have they made, not onely of their
            Service bookes, Portesses and Breviaries, but also of their Latine Translation? The
            Service booke supposed to be made by S. Ambrose (Officium Ambrosianum) was a great while
            in speciall use and request: but Pope Hadrian calling a Councill with the ayde of
            Charles the Emperour, abolished it, yea, burnt it, and commanded the Service-booke of
            Saint Gregorie universally to be used. Well, Officium Gregorianum gets by this meanes to
            be in credit, but doeth it continue without change or altering? No, the very Romane
            Service was of two fashions, the New fashion, and the Old, (the one used in one Church,
            the other in another) as is to bee seene in Pamelius a Romanist, his Preface, before
            Micrologus. The same Pamelius reporteth out of Radulphus de Rivo, that about the yeere
            of our Lord, 1277. Pope Nicolas the third removed out of the Churches of Rome, the more
            ancient bookes (of Service) and brought into use the Missals of the Friers Minorites,
            and commaunded them to bee observed there; insomuch that about an hundred yeeres after,
            when the above named Radulphus happened to be at Rome, he found all the bookes to be
            new, (of the new stampe.) Neither was there this chopping and changing in the more
            ancient times onely, but also of late: Pius Quintus himselfe confesseth, that every
            Bishopricke almost had a peculiar kind of service, most unlike to that which others had:
            which moved him to abolish all other Breviaries, though never so ancient, and
            priviledged and published by Bishops in their Dioceses, and to establish and ratifie
            that onely which was of his owne setting foorth, in the yeere 1568. Now, when the father
            of their Church, who gladly would heale the soare of the daughter of his people softly
            and sleightly, and make the best of it, findeth so great fault with them for their oddes
            and jarring; we hope the children have no great cause to vaunt of their uniformitie. But
            the difference that appeareth betweene our Translations, and our often correcting of
            them, is the thing that wee are specially charged with; let us see therefore whether
            they themselves bee without fault this way, (if it be to be counted a fault, to correct)
            and whether they bee fit men to throw stones at us: O tandem major parcas insane minori:
            they that are lesse sound themselves, ought not to object infirmities to others. If we
            should tell them that Valla, Stapulensis, Erasmus, and Vives found fault with their
            vulgar Translation, and consequently wished the same to be mended, or a new one to be
            made, they would answere peradventure, that we produced their enemies for witnesses
            against them; albeit, they were in no other sort enemies, then as S. Paul was to the
            Galatians, for telling them the trueth: and it were to be wished, that they had dared to
            tell it them plainlier and oftner. But what will they say to this, that Pope Leo the
            tenth allowed Erasmus Translation of the New Testament, so much different from the
            vulgar, by his Apostolike Letter &amp; Bull; that the same Leo exhorted Pagnin to
            translate the whole Bible, and bare whatsoever charges was necessary for the worke?
            Surely, as the Apostle reasoneth to the Hebrewes, that if the former Law and Testament
            had bene sufficient, there had beene no need of the latter: so we may say, that if the
            olde vulgar had bene at all points allowable, to small purpose had labour and charges
            bene undergone, about framing of a new. If they say, it was one Popes private opinion,
            and that he consulted onely himselfe; then wee are able to goe further with them, and to
            averre, that more of their chiefe men of all sorts, even their owne Trent-champions
            Paiva &amp; Vega, and their owne Inquisitors, Hieronymus ab Oleastro, and their own
            Bishop Isidorus Clarius, and their owne Cardinall Thomas à Vio Caietan, doe either make
            new Translations themselves, or follow new ones of other mens making, or note the vulgar
            Interpretor for halting; none of them feare to dissent from him, nor yet to except
            against him. And call they this an uniforme tenour of text and judgement about the text,
            so many of their Worthies disclaiming the now received conceit? Nay, we wil yet come
            neerer the quicke: doth not their Paris-edition differ from the Louaine, and Hentenius
            his from them both, and yet all of them allowed by authoritie? Nay, doth not Sixtus
            Quintus confesse, that certaine Catholikes (he meaneth certainte of his owne side) were
            in such an humor of translating the Scriptures into Latine, that Satan taking occasion
            by them, though they thought of no such matter, did strive what he could, out of so
            uncertaine and manifold a varietie of Translations, so to mingle all things, that
            nothing might seeme to be left certaine and firme in them, &amp;c? Nay, further, did not
            the same Sixtus ordaine by an inviolable decree, and that with the counsell and consent
            of his Cardinals, that the Latine edition of the olde and new Testament, which the
            Councill of Trent would have to be authenticke, is the same without controversie which
            he then set forth, being diligently corrected and printed in the Printing-house of
            Vatican? Thus Sixtus in his Preface before his Bible. And yet Clement the eight his
            immediate successour, publisheth another edition of the Bible, containing in it infinite
            differences from that of Sixtus, (and many of them waightie and materiall) and yet this
            must be authenticke by all meanes. What is to have the faith of our glorious Lord JESUS
            CHRIST with Yea and Nay, if this be not? Againe, what is sweet harmonie and consent, if
            this be? Therfore, as Demaratus of Corinth advised a great King, before he talked of the
            dissentions among the Grecians, to compose his domesticke broiles (for at that time his
            Queene and his sonne and heire were at deadly fuide with him) so all the while that our
            adversaries doe make so many and so various editions themselves, and doe jarre so much
            about the worth and authoritie of them, they can with no show of equitie challenge us
            for changing and correcting. </p>

        <p> But it is high time to leave them, and to shew in briefe what wee proposed to our
            selves, and what course we held in this our perusall and survay of the Bible. Truly
            (good Christian Reader) wee never thought from the beginning, that we should neede to
            make a new Translation, nor yet to make of a bad one a good one, (for then the
            imputation of Sixtus had bene true in some sort, that our people had bene fed with gall
            of Dragons in stead of wine, with whey in stead of milke:) but to make a good one
            better, or out of many good ones, one principall good one, not justly to be excepted
            against; that hath bene our indeavour, that our marke. To that purpose there were many
            chosen, that were greater in other mens eyes then in their owne, and that sought the
            truth rather then their own praise. Againe, they came or were thought to come to the
            worke, not exercendi causâ (as one saith) but exercitati, that is, learned, not to
            learne: For the chiefe overseer and under his Majestie, to whom not onely we, but also
            our whole Church was much bound, knew by his wisedome, which thing also Nazianzen taught
            so long agoe, that it is a preposterous order to teach first and to learne after, yea
            that to learne and practise together, is neither commendable for the workeman, nor safe
            for the worke. Therefore such were thought upon, as could say modestly with Saint
            Jerome, Et Hebruæum Sermonem ex parte didicimus, &amp; in Latino penè ab ipsis
            incunabulis &amp;c. detriti sumus. Both we have learned the Hebrew tongue in part, and
            in the Latine wee have beene exercised almost from our verie cradle. S. Jerome maketh no
            mention of the Greeke tongue, wherein yet hee did excell, because hee translated not the
            old Testament out of Greeke, but out of Hebrewe. And in what sort did these assemble? In
            the trust of their owne knowledge, or of their sharpenesse of wit, or deepenesse of
            judgement, as it were in an arme of flesh? At no hand. They trusted in him that hath the
            key of David, opening and no man shutting: they prayed to the Lord the Father of our
            Lord, to the effect that S. Augustine did; O let thy Scriptures be my pure delight, let
            me not be deceived in them, neither let me deceive by them. In this confidence, and with
            this devotion did they assemble together; not too many, lest one should trouble another;
            and yet many, lest many things haply might escape them. If you aske what they had before
            them, truely it was the Hebrew text of the Olde Testament, the Greeke of the New. These
            are the two golden pipes, or rather conduits, where-through the olive branches emptie
            themselves into the golde. Saint Augustine calleth them precedent, or originall tongues;
            Saint Jerome, fountaines. The same Saint Jerome affirmeth, and Gratian hath not spared
            to put it into his Decree, That as the credit of the olde Bookes (he meaneth of the Old
            Testament) is to bee tryed by the Hebrewe Volumes, so of the New by the Greeke tongue,
            he meaneth by the originall Greeke. If trueth be to be tried by these tongues, then
            whence should a Translation be made, but out of them? These tongues, therefore, the
            Scriptures wee say in those tongues, wee set before us to translate, being the tongues
            wherein God was pleased to speake to his Church by his Prophets and Apostles. Neither
            did we run over the worke with that posting haste that the Septuagint did, if that be
            true which is reported of them, that they finished it in 72. dayes; neither were we
            barred or hindered from going over it againe, having once done it, like S. Jerome, if
            that be true which himselfe reporteth, that he could no sooner write any thing, but
            presently it was caught from him, and published, and he could not have leave to mend it:
            neither, to be short, were we the first that fell in hand with translating the Scripture
            into English, and consequently destitute of former helpes, as it is written of Origen,
            that hee was the first in a maner, that put his hand to write Commentaries upon the
            Scriptures, and therefore no marveile, if he overshot himselfe many times. None of these
            things: the worke hath not bene hudled up in 72. dayes, but hath cost the workemen, as
            light as it seemeth, the paines of twise seven times seventie two dayes and more:
            matters of such weight and consequence are to bee speeded with maturitie: for in a
            businesse of moment a man feareth not the blame of convenient slacknesse. Neither did
            wee thinke much to consult the Translators or Commentators, Chaldee, Hebrewe, Syrian,
            Greeke, or Latine, no nor the Spanish, French, Italian, or Dutch; neither did we
            disdaine to revise that which we had done, and to bring backe to the anvill that which
            we had hammered: but having and using as great helpes as were needfull, and fearing no
            reproch for slownesse, nor coveting praise for expedition, wee have at the length,
            through the good hand of the Lord upon us, brought the worke to that passe that you see. </p>

        <p> Some peradventure would have no varietie of sences to be set in the margine, lest the
            authoritie of the Scriptures for deciding of controversies by that shew of uncertaintie,
            should somewhat be shaken. But we hold their judgmet not to be so be so sound in this
            point. For though, whatsoever things are necessary are manifest, as S. Chrysostome
            saith, and as S. Augustine, In those things that are plainely set downe in the
            Scriptures, all such matters are found that concerne Faith, hope, and Charitie. Yet for
            all that it cannot be dissembled, that partly to exercise and whet our wits, partly to
            weane the curious from loathing of them for their every-where-plainenesse, partly also
            to stirre up our devotion to crave the assistance of Gods spirit by prayer, and lastly,
            that we might be forward to seeke ayd of our brethren by conference, and never scorne
            those that be not in all respects so complete as they should bee, being to seeke in many
            things our selves, it hath pleased God in his divine providence, heere and there to
            scatter wordes and sentences of that difficultie and doubtfulnesse, not in doctrinall
            points that concerne salvation, (for in such it hath beene vouched that the Scriptures
            are plaine) but in matters of lesse moment, that fearefulnesse would better beseeme us
            then confidence, and if we will resolve, to resolve upon modestie with S. Augustine,
            (though not in this same case altogether, yet upon the same ground) Melius est dubitare
            de occultis, quàm litigare de incertis, it is better to make doubt of those things which
            are secret, then to strive about those things that are uncertaine. There be many words
            in the Scriptures, which be never found there but once, (having neither brother nor
            neighbour, as the Hebrewes speake) so that we cannot be holpen by conference of places.
            Againe, there be many rare names of certaine birds, beastes and precious stones, &amp;c.
            concerning which the Hebrewes themselves are so divided among themselves for judgement,
            that they may seeme to have defined this or that, rather because they would say
            something, the because they were sure of that which they said, as S. Jerome somewhere
            saith of the Septuagint. Now in such a case, doth not a margine do well to admonish the
            Reader to seeke further, and not to conclude or dogmatize upon this or that
            peremptorily? For as it is a fault of incredulitie, to doubt of those things that are
            evident: so to determine of such things as the Spirit of God hath left (even in the
            judgment of the judicious) questionable, can beno lesse then presumption. Therfore as S.
            Augustine saith, that varietie of Translations is profitable for the finding out of the
            sense of the Scriptures: so diversitie of signification and sense in the margine, where
            the text is not so cleare, must needes doe good, yea is necessary, as we are perswaded.
            We know that Sixtus Quintus expresly forbiddeth, that any varietie of readings of their
            vulgar edition, should be put in the margine, (which though it be not altogether the
            same thing to that we have in hand, yet it looketh that way) but we thinke he hath not
            all of his owne side his favourers, for this conceit. They that are wise, had rather
            have their judgements at libertie in differences of readings, then to be captivated to
            one, when it may be the other. If they were sure that their hie Priest had all lawes
            shut up in his brest, as Paul the second bragged, and that he were as free from errour
            by speciall priviledge, as the Dictators of Rome were made by law inviolable, it were an
            other matter; then his word were an Oracle, his opinion a decision. But the eyes of the
            world are now open, God be thanked, and have bene a great while, they find that he is
            subject to the same affections and infirmities that others be, that his skin is
            penetrable, and therefore so much as he prooveth, not as much as he claimeth, they grant
            and embrace. </p>

        <p> An other thing we thinke good to admonish thee of (gentle Reader) that wee have not tyed
            our selves to an uniformitie of phrasing, or to an identitie of words, as some
            peradventure would wish that we had done, because they observe, that some learned men
            some where, have beene as exact as they could that way. Truly, that we might not varie
            from the sense of that which we had translated before, if the word signified the same
            thing in both places (for there bee some wordes that bee not of the same sense every
            where) we were especially carefull, and made a conscience, according to our duetie. But,
            that we should expresse the same notion in the same particular word; as for example, if
            we translate the Hebrew or Greeke word once by Purpose, never to call it Intent; if one
            where Journeying, never Traveiling; if one where Thinke, never Suppose; if one where
            Paine, never Ache; if one where Joy, never Gladnesse, &amp;c. Thus to minse the matter,
            wee thought to savour more of curiositie then wisedome, and that rather it would breed
            scorne in the Atheist, then bring profite to the godly Reader. For is the kingdome of
            God become words or syllables? why should wee be in bondage to them if we may be free,
            use one precisely when wee may use another no lesse fit, as commodiously? A godly Father
            in the Primitive time shewed himselfe greatly moved, that one of the newfanglenes called
            , though the difference be little or none; and another reporteth, that he was much
            abused for turning Cucurbita (to which reading the people had beene used) into Hedera.
            Now if this happen in better times, and upon so small occasions, wee might justly feare
            hard censure, if generally wee should make verball and unnecessary changings. We might
            also be charged (by scoffers) with some unequall dealing towards a great number of good
            English wordes. For as it is written of a certaine great Philosopher, that he should
            say, that those logs were happie that were made images to be worshipped; for their
            fellowes, as good as they, lay for blockes behinde the fire: so if wee should say, as it
            were, unto certaine words, Stand up higher, have a place in the Bible alwayes, and to
            others of like qualitie, Get ye hence, be banished for ever, wee might be taxed
            peradventure with S. James his words, namely, To be partiall in our selves and judges of
            evill thoughts. Adde hereunto, that nicenesse in wordes was alwayes counted the next
            step to trifling, and so was to bee curious about names too: also that we cannot follow
            a better patterne for elocution then God himselfe; therefore hee using divers words, in
            his holy writ, and indifferently for one thing in nature: we, if wee will not be
            superstitious, may use the same libertie in our English versions out of Hebrew &amp;
            Greeke, for that copie or store that he hath given us. Lastly, wee have on the one side
            avoided the scrupulositie of the Puritanes, who leave the olde Ecclesticall words, and
            betake them to other, as when they put washing for Baptisme, and Congregation in stead
            of Church: as also on the other side we have shunned the obscuritie of the Papists, in
            their Azimes, Tunike, Rational, Holocausts, Præpuce, Pasche, and a number of such like,
            whereof their late Translation is full, and that of purpose to darken the sence, that
            since they must needs translate the Bible, yet by the language thereof, it may bee kept
            from being understood. But we desire that the Scripture may speake like it selfe, as in
            the language of Canaan, that it may bee understood even of the very vulgar. </p>

        <p> Many other things we might give thee warning of (gentle Reader) if wee had not exceeded
            the measure of a Preface alreadie. It remaineth, that we commend thee to God, and to the
            Spirit of his grace, which is able to build further then we can aske or thinke. Hee
            removeth the scales from our eyes, the vaile from our hearts, opening our wits that wee
            may understand his word, enlarging our hearts, yea correcting our affections, that we
            may love it above gold and silver, yea that we may love it to the end. Ye are brought
            unto fountaines of living water which yee digged not; doe not cast earth into them with
            the Philistines, neither preferre broken pits before them with the wicked Jewes. Others
            have laboured, and you may enter into their labours; O receive not so great things in
            vaine, O despise not so great salvation! Be not like swine to treade under foote so
            precious things, neither yet like dogs to teare and abuse holy things. Say not to our
            Saviour with the Gergesites, Depart out of our coasts; neither yet with Esau sell your
            birthright for a messe of potage. If light be come into the world, love not darknesse
            more then light; if foode, if clothing be offered, goe not naked, starve not your
            selves. Remember the advise of Nazianzene, It is a grievous thing (or dangerous) to
            neglect a great faire, and to seeke to make markets afterwards: also the encouragement
            of S. Chrysostome, It is altogether impossible, that he that is sober (and watchfull)
            should at any time be neglected: Lastly, the admonition and menacing of S. Augustine,
            They that despise Gods will inviting them, shal feele Gods will taking vengeance of
            them. It is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the living God; but a blessed
            thing it is, and will bring us to everlasting blessednes in the end, when God speaketh
            unto us, to hearken; when he setteth his word before us, to reade it; when hee
            stretcheth out his hand and calleth, to answere, Here am I; here wee are to doe thy
            will, O God. The Lord worke a care and conscience in us to know him and serve him, that
            we may be acknowledged of him at the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with
            the holy Ghost, be all prayse and thankesgiving. Amen. </p>
