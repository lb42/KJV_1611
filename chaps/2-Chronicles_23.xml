<head>CHAP.
XXIII.</head>
<head>1 Iehoiada hauing set things in
order, maketh Ioash king. 12 Athaliah is slaine. 16 Iehoiada
restoreth the worship of God.</head>

<ab n="1">And in the
seuenth yeere Iehoiada strengthened himselfe, and tooke the
captaines of hundreds, Azariah the sonne of Ieroham, and Ishmael
the sonne of Iehohanan, and Azariah the sonne of Obed, and Maasiah
the sonne of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the sonne of Zichri, into
couenant with him.<note> 2.Kings 11.4,&amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And they
went about in Iudah, and gathered the Leuites out of all the cities
of Iudah, and the chiefe of the fathers of Israel, and they came to
Ierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="3">And all the
Congregation made a couenant with the king in the house of God: and
he said vnto them, Beholde, the kings sonne shall reigne, as the
Lord hath said of the sonnes of Dauid.<note> 2.Sam.11.12. 1.Kings 2.4. and 9.5 2.chr.6.16. and 7.18.</note></ab>

<fw>Ioash made king.</fw>
<ab n="4">This is the
thing that yee shall doe, A third part of you entring on the
Sabbath, of the priests and of the Leuites, shalbe porters of the
doores.<note> Heb. thresholds.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">And a thirde
part shall bee at the kings house, and a third part at the gate of
the foundation: and all the people shall be in the Courts of the
house of the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="6">But let none
come into the house of the Lord, saue the Priests, &amp; they that
minister of the Leuites, they shall go in, for they are holy: but
all the people shall keepe the watch of the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="7">And the
Leuites shall compasse the king round about, euery man with his
weapons in his hand, and whosoeuer else commeth into the house, hee
shalbe put to death: but be you with the King when he commeth in,
and when he goeth out.</ab>
<ab n="8">So the
Leuites and all Iudah did according to all things that Iehoiada the
Priest had commanded: and tooke euery man his men that were to come
in on the Sabbath, with them that were to goe out on the Sabbath:
for Iehoiada the Priest dismissed not the courses.</ab>
<ab n="9">Moreouer,
Iehoiada the Priest deliuered to the captaines of hundreds, speares
and bucklers, and shields, that had bene King Dauids, which were in
the house of God.</ab>
<ab n="10">And hee set
all the people (euery man hauing his weapon in his hand) from the
right side of the Temple, to the left side of the Temple, along by
the Altar and the Temple, by the King, round about.<note> Hebr. shoulder. , Heb. house.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">Then they
brought out the kings sonne, and put vpon him the Crowne, and gaue
him the Testimony, and made him King: and Iehoiada and his sonnes
anointed him, and said, God saue the King.<note> Deut.17. 18. , Hebr. Let the King liue.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">¶ Now
when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising
the King; she came to the people into the house of the
Lord.</ab>
<ab n="13">And she
looked, and behold, the king stood at his pillar, at the entring
in, and the Princes, and the trumpets by the King: and all the
people of the land reioyced, and sounded with trumpets; also the
singers with instruments of musicke; and such as taught to sing
praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason,
treason.<note> Hebr. conspiracie.</note></ab>

<fw>Athaliah slaine.</fw>
<ab n="14">Then
Iehoiada the Priest brought out the captaines of hundreds, that
were set ouer the host, and said vnto them, Haue her foorth of the
ranges: and who so followeth her, let him bee slaine with the
sword. For the Priest said; Slay her not in the house of the
Lord.</ab>
<ab n="15">So they
layd handes on her, and when shee was come to the entring of the
horse gate, by the kings house, they slew her there.</ab>
<ab n="16">¶ And
Iehoiada made a couenant betweene him, and betweene all the people,
and betweene the king, that they should be the Lords
people.</ab>
<ab n="17">Then all
the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it downe, and brake
his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of
Baal before the altars.<note> Deut.13. 13.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Also
Iehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the Lord by the hand
of the Priests the Leuites, whom Dauid had distributed in the house
of the Lord, to offer the burnt offrings of the Lord, as it is
written in the Law of Moses, with reioycing and with singing, as it
was ordeined by Dauid.<note> 1.Chro. 24.1. , Num.28. 2. , Hebr. by the hands of Dauid.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">And he set
the porters at the gates of the house of the Lord, that none which
was vncleane in any thing, should enter in.<note> 1.Chro. 26.1. &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">And hee
tooke the captaines of hundreds, and the nobles, and the gouernours
of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought downe
the king from the house of the Lord: and they came through the high
gate into the kings house, and set the king vpon the throne of the
kingdome.</ab>
<ab n="21">And all the
people of the land reioyced, and the city was quiet, after that
they had slaine Athaliah [wt] the sword.</ab>
