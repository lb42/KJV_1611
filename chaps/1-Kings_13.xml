<ab n="1">And behold, there
came a man of God out of Iudah by the word of the Lord vnto Bethel:
and Ieroboam stood by the altar to burne incense.<note> Or, to offer.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And hee cried
against the altar in the word of the Lord, and said, O altar,
altar, thus saith the Lord, Behold, a child shalbe borne vnto the
house of Dauid, Iosiah by name, and vpon thee shall he offer the
priests of the high places that burne incense vpon thee, and mens
bones shall bee burnt vpon thee.<note> 2.King. 23.17.</note></ab>

<fw>The man of God is slaine by a
lyon.</fw>
<ab n="3">And he gaue a
signe the same day, saying, This is the signe which the Lord hath
spoken: Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are
vpon it, shalbe powred out.</ab>
<ab n="4">And it came to
passe when king Ieroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which
had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand
from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him: And his hand which hee put
foorth against him, dried vp, so that hee could not pull it in
againe to him.</ab>
<ab n="5">The altar also
was rent, and the ashes powred out from the altar, according to the
signe which the man of God had giuen by the word of the
Lord.</ab>
<ab n="6">And the king
answered, and said vnto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the
Lord thy God, and pray for mee, that my hand may be restored mee
againe. And the man of God besought the Lord, and the kings hand
was restored againe, and became as it was before.<note> Hebr, the face of the LORD.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">And the king said
vnto the man of God, Come home with mee, and refresh thy selfe, and
I wil giue thee a reward.</ab>
<ab n="8">And the man of
God said vnto the king, If thou wilt giue mee halfe thine house, I
will not goe in with thee, neither will I eat bread, nor drinke
water in this place:</ab>
<ab n="9">For so was it
charged mee by the word of the Lord, saying, Eate no bread, nor
drinke water, nor turne again by the same way that thou
camest.</ab>
<ab n="10">So he went
another way, and returned not by the way that hee came to
Bethel.</ab>
<ab n="11">¶ Now there
dwelt an old Prophet in Bethel, and his sonne came and told him all
the workes that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the
words which hee had spoken vnto the king, them they tolde also to
their father.</ab>
<ab n="12">And their father
said vnto them, What way went he? for his sonnes had seene what way
the man of God went, which came from Iudah.</ab>
<ab n="13">And hee saide
vnto his sonnes, Saddle me the asse. So they sadled him the asse,
and he rode thereon,</ab>
<ab n="14">And went after
the man of God, and found him sitting vnder an oke; and he said
vnto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Iudah? And he
said, I am.</ab>

<fw>The man of God is slaine by a
lyon.</fw>
<ab n="15">Then hee said
vnto him, Come home with me, and eate bread.</ab>
<ab n="16">And he said, I
may not returne with thee, nor goe in with thee: neither will I eat
bread, nor drinke water with thee in this place.</ab>
<ab n="17">For it was said
to mee by the word of the Lord, Thou shalt eate no bread, nor
drinke water there, nor turne againe to go by the way that thou
camest.<note> Hebr. a word was.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">He said vnto
him, I am a prophet also as thou art, and an angel spake vnto me by
the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him backe with thee into thine
house, that he may eat bread, and drinke water: But he lied vnto
him.</ab>
<ab n="19">So he went backe
with him, and did eate bread in his house, and dranke
water.</ab>
<ab n="20">¶ And it
came to passe as they sate at the table, that the word of the Lord
came vnto the prophet that brought him backe:</ab>
<ab n="21">And he cried
vnto the man of God that came from Iudah, saying, Thus saith the
Lord, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeied the mouth of the Lord, and
hast not kept the commandement which the Lord thy God commanded
thee,</ab>
<ab n="22">But camest
backe, and hast eaten bread, and drunke water, in the place, of the
which the Lord did say to thee, Eate no bread, and drinke no water;
thy carcaise shall not come vnto the sepulchre of thy
fathers.</ab>
<ab n="23">¶ And it
came to passe after he had eaten bread, and after hee had drunke,
that he sadled for him the asse, to wit, for the Prophet, whome hee
had brought backe.</ab>
<ab n="24">And when he was
gone, a lyon met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcaise was
cast in the way, and the asse stood by it, the lyon also stood by
the carcaise.</ab>
<ab n="25">And beholde, men
passed by, and saw the carcaise cast in the way, and the lyon
standing by the carcaise: and they came and told it in the citie
where the old prophet dwelt.</ab>

<fw>His buriall.</fw>
<ab n="26">And when the
prophet that brought him back from the way, heard thereof, he said,
It is the man of God, who was disobedient vnto the word of the
Lord: therefore the Lord hath deliuered him vnto the lion, which
hath torne him, and slaine him, according to the word of the Lord,
which he spake vnto him.<note> Heb. broken.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">And he spake to
his sonnes, saying, Saddle me the asse: and they sadled
him.</ab>
<ab n="28">And he went and
found his carcaise cast in the way, and the asse and the lyon
standing by the carcaise: the lyon had not eaten the carcaise, nor
torne the asse.<note> Heb. broken.</note></ab>
<ab n="29">And the prophet
tooke vp the carcaise of the man of God, and laid it vpon the asse,
and brought it backe: and the old prophet came to the city, to
mourne, and to burie him.</ab>
<ab n="30">And hee laid his
carcaise in his owne graue, and they mourned ouer him, saying, Alas
my brother.</ab>
<ab n="31">And it came to
passe after hee had buried him, that he spake to his sonnes,
saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre, wherein the
man of God is buried, lay my bones beside his bones.</ab>
<ab n="32">For the saying
which hee cried by the word of the Lord against the altar in
Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in
the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to passe.</ab>
<ab n="33">¶ After
this thing, Ieroboam returned not from his euill way, but made
againe of the lowest of the people priests of the high places:
whosoeuer would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the
priests of the high places.<note> Heb. returned and made. , Heb. filled his hand.</note></ab>
<ab n="34">And this thing
became sinne vnto the house of Ieroboam, euen to cut it off, and to
destroy it from off the face of the earth.</ab>
