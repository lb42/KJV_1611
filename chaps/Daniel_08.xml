<head>CHAP.
VIII.</head>
<head>1 Daniels vision, of the Ram, and he
Goate. 13 The 2300. daies of sacrifice. 15 Gabriel comforteth
Daniel, and interpreteth the vision.</head>

<ab n="1">In the third
yeere of the reigne of King Belshazzar, a vision appeared vnto mee,
euen vnto me Daniel, after that which appeared vnto me at the
first.</ab>
<ab n="2">And I saw in
a vision (and it came to passe when I saw, that I was at Shushan in
the palace, which is in the prouince of Elam) and I saw in a
vision, and I was by the riuer of Ulai.</ab>
<ab n="3">Then I lifted
vp mine eyes, and saw, and behold, there stood before the riuer, a
ramme which had two hornes, and the two hornes were high: but one
was higher then the other, and the higher came vp last.<note> Heb. the second.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">I saw the
ramme pushing Westward, &amp; Northward, and Southward: so that no
beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could
deliuer out of his hand, but he did according to his will, and
became great.</ab>

<fw>The vision of the ramme and
goat.</fw>
<ab n="5">And as I was
considering, behold, an he goat came frō the west on the face
of the whole earth, &amp; touched not the ground: and the goate had
a notable horne betweene his eyes.<note> Or, none touched him in the earth. , Hebr. a horne of sight.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">And he came
to the ramme that had two hornes, which I had seene standing before
the riuer, and ranne vnto him in the furie of his power.</ab>
<ab n="7">And I saw him
come close vnto the ramme, and he was mooued with choler against
him, and smote the ramme, and brake his two hornes, and there was
no power in the ramme to stand before him, but he cast him downe to
the ground, and stamped vpon him, and there was none that could
deliuer the ramme out of his hand.</ab>
<ab n="8">Therefore the
hee goate waxed very great, and when he was strong, the great horne
was broken: and for it came vp foure notable ones, toward the foure
windes of heauen.<note> Cha.11.4</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And out of
one of them came forth a litle horne, which waxed exceeding great,
toward the South, and toward the East, and toward the pleasant
land.<note> Psal.48. 2 ezek.20.6.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">And it waxed great
euen to the hoste of heauen, and it cast downe some of the hoste,
and of the starres to the ground, and stamped vpon
them.<note> Or, against the hoste.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">Yea he magnified
himselfe euen to the prince of the hoste, and by him the dayly
sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his Sanctuary was cast
down.<note> Or, against , Or, from him.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">And an hoste was
giuen him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression,
and it cast downe the trueth to the ground, and it practised, and
prospered.<note> Or, the host was giuen ouer for the transgression against the daily sacrifice.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">¶ Then I
heard one Saint speaking, and another Saint saide vnto that
certaine Saint which spake, How long shall bee the vision
concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of
desolation, to giue both the Sanctuary, and the hoste to be troden
vnder foot?<note> The numberer of secrets, or, the wonderfull numberer. Heb. Palmoni. , Or, making desolate.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And he said vnto
me, Unto two thousand and three hundred dayes: then shall the
Sanctuary be clensed.<note> Heb. euening morning. , Heb. iustified.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">¶ And it came
to passe, when I, euen I Daniel had seene the vision, and sought
for the meaning, then beholde, there stood before me as the
appearance of a man.</ab>
<ab n="16">And I heard a mans
voyce betweene the bankes of Ulai, which called and said, Gabriel,
make this man to vnderstand the vision.<note> Cha.9.21.</note></ab>

<fw>The vision of the ramme and
goat.</fw>
<ab n="17">So he came neere
where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell vpon my
face: but he said vnto mee, Understand, O sonne of man: for at the
time of the end shalbe the vision.</ab>
<ab n="18">Now as he was
speaking with me, I was in a deepe sleepe on my face toward the
ground: but he touched me, and set me vpright.<note> Heb. made me stand vpon my standing.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">And he said,
Behold, I wil make thee know what shall be in the last end of the
indignation: for at the time appointed the end shalbe.</ab>
<ab n="20">The ramme which
thou sawest hauing two hornes, are the kings of Media, and
Persia.</ab>
<ab n="21">And the rough goat
is the king of Grecia, and the great horne that is betweene his
eyes, is the first king.</ab>
<ab n="22">Now that being
broken, whereas foure stood vp for it, foure kingdomes shall stand
vp out of the nation, but not in his power.</ab>
<ab n="23">And in the latter
time of their kingdome, when the transgressours are come to the
full, a king of fierce countenance, and vnderstanding darke
sentences, shall stand vp.<note> Heb. are accomplished.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">And his power
shall be mighty, but not by his owne power: and hee shall destroy
wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the
mightie, and the holy people.<note> Heb. people of the holy ones.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">And through his
policie also hee shall cause craft to prosper in his hand, and hee
shall magnifie himselfe in his heart, and by peace shal destroy
many: he shall also stand vp against the prince of princes, but he
shalbe broken without hand.<note> Or, prosperitie. , 2.Mac.6.9</note></ab>
<ab n="26">And the vision of
the euening, and the morning, which was tolde, is true: wherfore
shut thou vp the vision, for it shalbe for many dayes.</ab>
<ab n="27">And I Daniel
fainted and was sicke certaine dayes: afterward I rose vp and did
the kings businesse, and I was astonished at the vision, but none
vnderstood it.</ab>
