<head>CHAP. II.</head>
<head>1 An exhortation to repentance. 4
The iudgement of the Philistines, 8 Of Moab and Ammon, 12 Of
Ethiopia and Assyria.</head>

<ab n="1">Gather your
selues together, yea gather together, O nation not
desired.<note> Or, not desirous.</note></ab>

<fw>Seeke the Lord.</fw>
<ab n="2">Before the
decree bring foorth, before the day passe as the chaffe, before the
fierce anger of the Lord come vpon you, before the day of the Lords
anger come vpon you.</ab>
<ab n="3">Seeke ye the
Lord all ye meeke of the earth, which haue wrought his iudgement,
seeke righteousnesse, seeke meeknesse: it may be, ye shall be hid
in the day of the Lords anger.</ab>
<ab n="4">¶ For Gaza
shall bee forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall driue out
Ashdod at the noone day, and Ekron shall be rooted vp.</ab>
<ab n="5">Woe vnto the
inhabitants of the sea coast: the nation of the Cherethites, the
word of the Lord is against you: O Canaan, the land of the
Philistines, I will euen destroy thee, that there shal be no
inhabitant.</ab>
<ab n="6">And the sea
coast shall bee dwellings and cottages for shepheards, and foldes
for flockes.</ab>
<ab n="7">And the coast
shall bee for the remnant of the house of Iudah, they shall feede
thereupon, in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie downe in the
euening: for the Lord their God shall visite them, and turne away
their captiuitie.<note> Or, when, &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">¶ I haue
heard the reproach of Moab, and the reuilings of the children of
Ammon, whereby they haue reproched my people, and magnified
themselues against their border.</ab>
<ab n="9">Therefore, as I
liue, saith the Lord of hostes the God of Israel, surely Moab
shalbe as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, euen the
breeding of netles, and salt pits, and a perpetuall desolation, the
residue of my people shall spoile them, and the remnant of my
people shall possesse them.</ab>
<ab n="10">This shall they
haue for their pride, because they haue reproched and magnified
themselues against the people of the Lord of hostes.</ab>
<ab n="11">The Lord will
be terrible vnto them: for he will famish all the gods of the
earth, and men shall worship him, euery one from his place, euen
all the Iles of the heathen.<note> Heb. make leane.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">¶ Ye
Ethiopians also, ye shalbe slaine by my sword.</ab>
<ab n="13">And he wil
stretch out his hand against the North, and destroy Assyria, and
wil make Nineueh a desolation, and dry like a wildernes.</ab>

<fw>The carelesse citie.</fw>
<ab n="14">And flocks
shall lie downe in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations:
both the Cormorant, and the Bitterne, shall lodge in the vpper
lintels of it: their voice shal sing in the windowes, desolation
shall be in the thresholds: for he shall vncouer the Cedar
worke.<note> Or, Pellican , Isai 34.11, &amp;c. , Or, knops. or chapiters. , Or, when he hath vncouered.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">This is the
reioycing citie that dwelt carelessely, that said in her heart, I
am, and there is none beside me: how is shee become a desolation, a
place for beasts to lie downe in! euery one that passeth by her,
shall hisse and wagge his hand.<note> Isai 47.8.</note></ab>
