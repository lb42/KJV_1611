<head>CHAP. XX.</head>
<head>1 Pashur smiting Ieremiah, receiueth
a newe name, and a fearefull doome. 7 Ieremiah complaineth of
contempt, 10 of treachery, 14 and of his birth.</head>


<fw>Pashurs name.</fw>
<ab n="1">Now Pashur the
sonne of Immer the Priest, who was also chiefe gouernor in the
house of the Lord, heard that Ieremiah prophecied these
things.<note> 1. Chro. 24.14.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">Then Pashur
smote Ieremiah the Prophet, and put him in the stockes that were in
the high gate of Beniamin, which was by the house of the
Lord.</ab>
<ab n="3">And it came to
passe on the morrow, that Pashur brought foorth Ieremiah out of the
stockes. Then sayd Ieremiah vnto him, The Lord hath not called thy
name Pashur, but Magor-missabib.<note> That is, feare round about.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">For thus sayth
the Lord, Behold, I will make thee a terrour to thy selfe, and to
all thy friends, and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies,
and thine eyes shall behold it, and I will giue all Iudah into the
hand of the king of Babylon, and hee shall cary them captiue into
Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.</ab>
<ab n="5">Moreouer, I will
deliuer all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof,
and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the
kings of Iudah will I giue into the hand of their enemies which
shal spoile them, and take them and cary them to
Babylon.<note> 2.Kings 20.17.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">And thou Pashur,
and all that dwell in thine house, shall goe into captiuitie, and
thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be
buried there, thou and all thy friends to whom thou hast prophecied
lies.</ab>
<ab n="7">¶ O Lord,
thou hast deceiued me, and I was deceiued, thou art stronger then
I, and hast preuailed: I am in derision daily, euery one mocketh
me.<note> Or, enticed.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">For since I
spake I cryed out, I cried violence and spoyle; because the word of
the Lord was made a reproch vnto me, and a derision daily?</ab>
<ab n="9">Then I said; I
will not make mention of him, nor speake any more in his name. But
his word was in mine heart, as a burning fire shut vp in my bones,
and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.<note> Psal.39.3. , Iob 32.18.</note></ab>

<fw>Impatiencie.</fw>
<ab n="10">¶ For I
heard the defaming of many, feare on euery side. Report, say they,
and wee will report it: all my familiars watched for my halting,
saying; Peraduenture he will be enticed: and we shall preuaile
against him, and we shall take our reuenge on him.<note> Heb. euery man of my peace.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">But the Lord is
with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutours shall
stumble, and they shall not preuaile, they shall be greatly
ashamed, for they shall not prosper, their euerlasting confusion
shall neuer be forgotten.<note> Chap. 17. 18. and 15. 20. , Chap. 23. 40.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">But O Lord of
hostes, that tryest the righteous, and seest the reines and the
heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for vnto thee haue I
opened my cause.<note> Chap. 11. 20. and 17. 10.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Sing vnto the
Lord, praise yee the Lord: for hee hath deliuered the soule of the
poore from the hand of euill doers.</ab>
<ab n="14">¶ Cursed
be the day wherein I was borne: let not the day wherein my mother
bare mee, be blessed.</ab>
<ab n="15">Cursed be the
man who brought tidings to my father, saying: A man child is borne
vnto thee, making him very glad.<note> Iob.3.3. chap. 15.10.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">And let that
man be as the cities which the Lord ouerthrew and repented not: and
let him heare the cry in the morning, and the shouting at
noonetide,<note> Gen.19. 25.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">Because he slew
me not from the wombe: or that my mother might haue beene my graue,
and her wombe to be alwaies great with me.</ab>
<ab n="18">Wherefore came
I forth out of the wombe to see labour and sorrow, that my daies
should be consumed with shame?<note> Iob.3.20.</note></ab>
