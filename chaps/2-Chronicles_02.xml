<fw>Preparation for the Temple.</fw>
<ab n="4">Behold, I

him, and to burne before him sweet incense, and for the continuall

Lord our God. This is an ordinance for euer to Israel.<note> Heb. incense of spices.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">And the house
which I build, is great: for great is our God aboue all
gods.</ab>
<ab n="6">But who is
able to build him an house, seeing the heauen, and heauen of
heauens cannot conteine him? who am I then that I should build him
an house? saue onely to burne sacrifice before him?<note> 1.King.8. 27. 2.chro. 6.18. , Heb. hath retained, or obtained strength.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">Send me now
therefore a man, cunning to worke in gold and in siluer, and in

I will giue to thy seruants the hewers that cut timber, twentie

baths of oyle.</ab>
<ab n="11">¶ Then
Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which hee sent to
Solomon: Because the Lord hath loued his people, hee hath made thee
King ouer them.</ab>
<ab n="12">Huram said
moreouer, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel that made heauen and
earth, who hath giuen to Dauid the King a wise sonne, indued with
prudence and vnderstanding, that might build an house for the Lord,
and an house for his kingdome.<note> Heb. knowing prudence and vnderstanding.</note></ab>

stone and in timber, in purple, in blew, and in fine linen, and in
crimson: also to graue any maner of grauing, and to find out euery
deuice which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with
the cunning men of my lord Dauid thy father.</ab>
<ab n="15">Now
therefore the wheate and the barley, the oyle and the wine, which
my lord hath spoken of, let him send vnto his seruants:</ab>
<ab n="16">And wee will
cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need, and wee will
bring it to thee in flotes by sea to Ioppa, and thou shalt carie it
vp to Ierusalem.<note> Heb. according to all thy need. , Heb. Iapho</note></ab>
