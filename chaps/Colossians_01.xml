<ab n="1">Paul an Apostle
of Iesus Christ, by Ã¾<note/> will of God, and Timotheus
our brother,</ab>
<ab n="2">To the saints
and faithfull brethren in Christ, which are at Colosse, grace be
vnto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Iesus
Christ.</ab>
<ab n="3">We giue thanks
to God, and the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, praying alwayes
for you,</ab>
<ab n="4">Since we heard
of your faith in Christ Iesus, and of the loue which yee haue to
all the Saints,</ab>
<ab n="5">For the hope
which is layd vp for you in heauen, whereof ye heard before in the
word of the trueth of the Gospel,</ab>
<ab n="6">Which is come
vnto you as it is in all the world, and bringeth foorth fruit, as
it doth also in you, since the day yee heard of it, and knew the
grace of God in trueth,</ab>
<ab n="7">As yee also
learned of Epaphras our deare felow seruant, who is for you a
faithfull Minister of Christ:</ab>
<ab n="8">Who also
declared vnto vs your loue in the spirit.</ab>
<ab n="9">For this cause
wee also, since the day we heard it, doe not cease to pray for you,
and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his
will, in all wisedome and spirituall vnderstanding:</ab>

<fw>Christ the Head.</fw>
<ab n="10">That ye might
walke worthy of the Lord vnto all pleasing, being fruitfull in
euery good worke, &amp; increasing in the knowledge of God:</ab>
<ab n="11">Strengthened
with all might according to his glorious power, vnto all patience
and long suffering with ioyfulnesse:</ab>
<ab n="12">Giuing thanks
vnto the Father, which hath made vs meete to be partakers of the
inheritance of the Saints in light:</ab>
<ab n="13">Who hath
deliuered vs from the power of darkenesse, and hath translated vs
into the kingdome of his deare Sonne,<note> Gr. the Sonne of his loue.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">In whom we
haue redemption through his blood, euen the forgiuenesse of
sinnes:</ab>
<ab n="15">Who is the
image of the inuisible God, the first borne of euery
creature.</ab>
<ab n="16">For by him
were all things created that are in heauen, and that are in earth,
visible and inuisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or
principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for
him.</ab>
<ab n="17">And he is
before all things, and by him all things consist.<note> 1.Cor.8.6 ioh.1.3.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">And hee is the
head of the body, the Church: who is the beginning, the first borne
from the dead, that in all things he might haue the
preeminence:<note> Or, among all.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">For it pleased
the Father that in him should all fulnesse dwell,</ab>
<ab n="20">And (hauing
made peace through the blood of his crosse) by him to reconcile all
things vnto himself, by him, I say, whether they bee things in
earth, or things in heauen.<note> Or, making peace.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">And you that
were sometimes alienated, and enemies in your minde by wicked
workes, yet now hath hee reconciled,<note> Or, by your mind in wicked works.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">In the body of
his flesh through death, to present you holy &amp; vnblameable, and
vnreprooueable in his sight,</ab>

<fw>How to walke in Christ Iesus.</fw>
<ab n="23">If ye continue
in the faith grounded and setled, and be not moued away from the
hope of the Gospel, which yee haue heard, and which was preached to
euery creature which is vnder heauen, whereof I Paul am made a
Minister.</ab>
<ab n="24">Who now
reioyce in my sufferings for you, and fill vp that which is behind
of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for his bodies sake,
which is the Church,</ab>
<ab n="25">Whereof I am
made a Minister, according to the dispensation of God, which is
giuen to mee for you, to fulfill the word of God:<note> Or, fully to preach the word of God, Rom. 1.19.</note></ab>
<ab n="26">Euen the
mystery which hath been hid from ages, and from generations, but
now is made manifest to his saints,</ab>
<ab n="27">To whom God
would make knowen what is the riches of the glory of this mysterie
among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of
glory:<note> Or, amongst you.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">Whom we
preach, warning euery man, and teaching euery man in all wisedome,
that we may present euery man perfect in Christ Iesus.</ab>
<ab n="29">Whereunto I
also labour, striuing according to his working, which worketh in me
mightily.</ab>
