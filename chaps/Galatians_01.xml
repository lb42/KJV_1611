<head>CHAP. I.</head>
<head>6 Hee wondereth that they haue so
soone left him, and the Gospel, 8 And accurseth those that preach
any other Gospel then hee did. 11 He learned the Gospel not of men,
but of God: 14 And sheweth what he was before his calling, 17 and
what he did presently after it.</head>

<ab n="1">Paul an Apostle,
not of men, neither by man, but by Iesus Christ, and God the
Father, who raised him fr≈ç the dead,</ab>
<ab n="2">And all the
brethren which are with mee, vnto the Churches of Galatia:</ab>
<ab n="3">Grace bee to you
and peace, from God the Father, and from our Lord Iesus
Christ,</ab>
<ab n="4">Who gaue
himselfe for our sinnes, that he might deliuer vs from this present
euill world, according to the will of God, and our Father,</ab>
<ab n="5">To whom bee
glorie for euer and euer, Amen.</ab>
<ab n="6">I marueile, that
you are so soone remoued from him, that called you into the grace
of Christ, vnto an other Gospel:</ab>
<ab n="7">Which is not
another; but there bee some that trouble you, and would peruert the
Gospel of Christ.</ab>

<fw>Pauls doctrine.</fw>
<ab n="8">But though we,
or an Angel from heauen, preach any other Gospel vnto you, then
that which wee haue preached vnto you, let him be accursed.</ab>
<ab n="9">As we said
before, so say I now againe, If any man preach any other Gospel
vnto you, then that yee haue receiued, let him be accursed.</ab>
<ab n="10">For doe I now
perswade men, or God? or doe I seeke to please men? For if I yet
pleased men, I should not bee the seruant of Christ.</ab>
<ab n="11">But I certifie
you, brethren, that the Gospel which was preached of me, is not
after man.</ab>
<ab n="12">For I neither
receiued it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the reuelation
of Iesus Christ.</ab>
<ab n="13">For yee haue
heard of my couuersation in time past, in the Iewes Religion, how
that beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God, and wasted
it:</ab>
<ab n="14">And profited in
the Iewes Religion, aboue many my equals in mine owne nation, being
more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my
fathers.<note> Gr. equals in yeeres.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">But when it
pleased God, who separated me from my mothers wombe, and called me
by his grace,</ab>
<ab n="16">To reueale his
sonne in mee, that I might preach him among the heathen, immediatly
I conferred not with flesh and blood:</ab>
<ab n="17">Neither went I
vp to Ierusalem, to them which were Apostles before me, but I went
into Arabia, and returned againe vnto Damascus.</ab>
<ab n="18">Then after
three yeeres, I went vp to Ierusalem to see Peter, and abode with
him fifteene dayes.<note> Or, returned.</note></ab>

<fw>Pauls courage.</fw>
<ab n="19">But other of
the Apostles saw I none, saue Iames the Lords brother.</ab>
<ab n="20">Now the things
which I write vnto you, behold, before God I lye not.</ab>
<ab n="21">Afterwards I
came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia,</ab>
<ab n="22">And was
vnknowen by face vnto the Churches of Iudea, which were in
Christ.</ab>
<ab n="23">But they had
heard onely, that he which persecuted vs in times past, now
preacheth the faith, which once hee destroyed.</ab>
<ab n="24">And they
glorified God in me.</ab>
