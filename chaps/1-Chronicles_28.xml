<ab n="1">And Dauid

and the captaines ouer the thousands, and captaines ouer the

<ab n="2">Then Dauid
the king stood vp vpon his feete, and said, Heare me, my brethren,
and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to builde an house of
rest for the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord, and for the
footestoole of our God, &amp; had made ready for the
building.<note> 2.Sam. 7.5,13. 1 kin. 5.5. 1.chro. 22.8.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">But God said
vnto me, Thou shalt not builde an house for my Name, because thou
hast been a man of warre, and hast shed blood.<note> Heb. bloods</note></ab>
<ab n="4">Howbeit, the
Lord God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father, to
be king ouer Israel for euer: for he hath chosen Iudah to be the
ruler; &amp; of the house of Iudah, the house of my father; and
among the sonnes of my father, he liked me to make me king ouer all
Israel:<note> Gen. 49.8. 1.sam. 16. 13. psal. 78. 67.</note></ab>

<fw>Dauid exhorteth his sonne
Solomon.</fw>
<ab n="5">And of all

Solomon my sonne, to sit vpon the throne of the kingdome of the
Lord ouer Israel.<note> Cha. 23.1.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">And he said
vnto me, Solomon thy sonne, hee shall build my house and my courts:
for I haue chosen him to be my sonne, and I will be his
father.<note> 2.Sam.7. 13. 2.chro. 1.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">Moreouer, I
will establish his kingdome for euer, if he be constant to do my
commandements and my iudgements, as at this day.<note> Heb. strong</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Now
therefore in the sight of all Israel, the congregation of the Lord,
and in the audience of our God, keepe, and seeke for all the
commandements of the Lord your God, that ye may possesse this good
land, and leaue it for an inheritance for your children after you,
for euer.</ab>
<ab n="9">¶ And
thou, Solomon my sonne, know thou the God of thy father, and serue
him with a perfite heart, and with a willing minde: for the Lord
searcheth all hearts, and vnderstandeth all the imaginations of the
thoughts: if thou seeke him, he will be found of thee, but if thou
forsake him, he will cast thee off for euer.<note> 1. Sam. 16. 7. psal. 139. 2.and 7.9. iere. 11.20. and 17. 10. and 20. 12.</note></ab>

golde by weight, for things of golde, for all instruments of all
manner of seruice: siluer also for all instruments of siluer, by
weight, for all instruments of euery kinde of seruice:</ab>

<fw>Dauid exhorteth his sonne
Solomon.</fw>
<ab n="15">Euen the

golde, by weight for euery candlesticke, and for the lampes

<ab n="19">All this,
sayd Dauid, the Lord made mee understand in writing by his hand
vpon mee, euen all the workes of this paterne.</ab>
<ab n="20">And Dauid
said to Solomon his sonne, Be strong, and of good courage, and doe
it: feare not, nor be dismayed, for the Lord God, euen my God, will
be with thee; he will not faile thee, nor forsake thee, vntill thou
hast finished all the worke for the seruice of the house of the
Lord.</ab>
<ab n="21">And behold,
the courses of the Priests and the Leuites, euen they shall be with
thee for all the seruice of the house of God, and there shall be
with thee for all manner of workemanship, euery willing skilfull
man, for any maner of seruice: also the Princes and all the people
will bee wholly at thy commandement.</ab>
