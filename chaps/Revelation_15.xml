<ab n="1">And I saw
another signe in heauen great and marueilous, seuen Angels hauing
the seuen last plagues, for in them is filled vp the wrath of
God.</ab>

<fw>Vials of wrath.</fw>
<ab n="2">And I saw as
it were a Sea of glasse, mingled with fire, and them that had
gotten the victorie ouer the beast, and ouer his image, and ouer
his marke, and ouer the number of his name, stand on the sea of
glasse, hauing the harpes of God.</ab>
<ab n="3">And they sing
the song of Moses the seruant of God, and the song of the Lambe,
saying, Great and marueilous are thy workes, Lord God Almightie,
iust and true are thy wayes, thou king of saints.<note> Exo.15.1. , Psal.145 17.</note></ab>

feare thee, O Lord, and glorifie thy Name? for thou onely art holy:
for all nations shall come and worship before thee, for thy
iudgements are made manifest.<note> Iere.10.7.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">And after that
I looked, and behold, the Temple of the tabernacle of the testimony
in heauen was opened:</ab>
<ab n="6">And the seuen
Angels came out of the Temple, hauing the seuen plagues, clothed in
pure and white linnen, and hauing their breasts girded with golden
girdles.</ab>
<ab n="7">And one of the
foure beasts gaue vnto the seuen Angels, seuen golden vials, full
of the wrath of God, who liueth for euer and euer.</ab>
<ab n="8">And the Temple
was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power,
and no man was able to enter into the Temple, till the seuen
plagues of the seuen Angels were fulfilled.</ab>
