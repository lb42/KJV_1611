<head>CHAP. IX.</head>
<head>1 Iob acknowledging Gods iustice,
sheweth there is no contending with him. 22 Mans innocencie is not
to be condemned by afflictions.</head>

<ab n="1">Then Iob
answered, and said,</ab>
<ab n="2">I know it is so
of a trueth: but howe should man be iust with God.<note> Psal.143. 2. , Or, before God.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">If he will
contend with him, he cannot answere him one of a thousand.</ab>
<ab n="4">He is wise in
heart, and mightie in strength: who hath hardened himselfe against
him, and hath prospered?</ab>

<fw>Gods power, and iustice.</fw>
<ab n="5">Which remoueth
the mountains, and they know not: which ouerturneth them in his
anger:</ab>
<ab n="6">Which shaketh
the earth out of her place, &amp; the pillars thereof
tremble:</ab>
<ab n="7">Which commandeth
the Sunne, and it riseth not: and sealeth vp the starres.</ab>
<ab n="8">Which alone
spreadeth out the heauens, and treadeth vpon the waues of the
Sea.<note> Gen.1.6. , Hebr. heights</note></ab>
<ab n="9">Which maketh
Arcturus, Orion and Pleiades, and the chambers of the
South.<note> Amos 5.8. iob. 38.31, &amp;c. , Heb. Ash, Cesil, and Cimah.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">Which doeth
great things past finding out, yea and wonders without
number.<note> See Chap. 5.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">Loe, hee goeth
by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceiue him
not.</ab>
<ab n="12">Behold, he
taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say vnto him, What doest
thou?<note> Isai.45.9. iere.18.6. rom 9.20. , Heb. who can turne him away?</note></ab>
<ab n="13">If God will not
withdraw his anger, the proud helpers doe stoupe vnder
him.<note> Heb. helpers of pride, or strength.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">How much lesse
shall I answere him, and choose out my words to reason with
him?</ab>
<ab n="15">Whom, though I
were righteous, yet would I not answere, but I would make
supplication to my Iudge.</ab>
<ab n="16">If I had
called, and had answered me, yet would I not beleeue that he had
hearkened vnto my voice:</ab>
<ab n="17">For he breaketh
me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.</ab>
<ab n="18">Hee will not
suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with
bitternesse.</ab>
<ab n="19">If I speake of
strength, loe, hee is strong: and if of iudgement, who shall set me
a time to pleade?</ab>
<ab n="20">If I iustifie
my selfe, mine owne mouth shall condemne me: If I say, I am
perfect, it shall also prooue me peruerse.</ab>
<ab n="21">Though I were
perfect, yet would I not know my soule: I would despise my
life.</ab>
<ab n="22">This is one
thing, therefore I said it; he destroyeth the perfect and the
wicked.</ab>
<ab n="23">If the scourge
slay suddenly, hee will laugh at the triall of the
innocent.</ab>
<ab n="24">The earth is
giuen into the hand of the wicked: he couereth the faces of the
Iudges thereof; if not, where, and who is hee?</ab>

<fw>Gods power, and iustice. Mans
righteousnesse.</fw>
<ab n="25">Now my dayes
are swifter then a Poste: they flee away, they see no good.</ab>
<ab n="26">They are passed
away as the ships: as the Eagle that hasteth to the
pray.<note> Hebr. ships of desire. , Or, ships of Ebeh.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">If I say, I
will forget my complaint, I will leaue off my heauinesse, and
comfort my selfe.</ab>
<ab n="28">I am afraid of
all my sorrowes, I know that thou wilt not holde me
innocent.</ab>
<ab n="29">If I be wicked,
why then labour I in vaine?</ab>
<ab n="30">If I wash my
selfe with snow water, and make my handes neuer so cleane:</ab>
<ab n="31">Yet shalt thou
plunge me in the ditch, and mine owne clothes shall abhorre
me.<note> Or, make me to be abhorred.</note></ab>
<ab n="32">For he is not a
man as I am, that I should answere him, and we should come together
in iudgement.</ab>
<ab n="33">Neither is
there any dayes-man betwixt vs, that might lay his hand vpon vs
both.<note> Heb. one that should argue. , Or, Umpire.</note></ab>
<ab n="34">Let him take
his rodde away from me, &amp; let not his feare terrifie
me:</ab>
<ab n="35">Then would I
speake, and not feare him; but it is not so with me.<note> Heb. but I am not so with my selfe.</note></ab>
