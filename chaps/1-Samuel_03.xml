<head>CHAP.
III.</head>
<head>1 How the word of the Lord was first
reuealed to Samuel. 11 God telleth Samuel the destruction of Elies
house. 15 Samuel, though loth, telleth Eli the vision. 19 Samuel
groweth in credit.</head>

<ab n="1">And the child
Samuel ministred vnto the Lord before Eli: and the word of the Lord
was precious in those daies; there was no open vision.</ab>
<ab n="2">And it came to
passe at that time, when Eli was layd downe in his place, and his
eyes beganne to waxe dimme, that he could not see;</ab>
<ab n="3">And yer the lampe
of God went out in the Temple of the Lord, where the Arke of God
was, and Samuel was layd downe to sleepe;</ab>
<ab n="4">That the Lord
called Samuel, and he answered, Here am I.</ab>

<fw>God calleth Samuel.</fw>
<ab n="5">And he ranne vnto
Eli, and sayd, Here am I, for thou calledst me. And he said, I
called not; lie downe againe. And he went and lay downe.</ab>
<ab n="6">And the Lord
called yet againe, Samuel. And Samuel arose, and went to Eli, and
said, Here am I, for thou diddest call me. And he answered, I
called not, my sonne; lie downe againe.</ab>
<ab n="7">Now Samuel did
not yet know the Lord, neither was the word of the Lord yet
reuealed vnto him.<note> Or, thus did Samuel, before he knew the LORD; and before the word of the LORD was reuealed vnto him.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">And the Lord
called Samuel againe the third time. And hee arose, and went to
Eli, and said, Here am I, for thou diddest call me. And Eli
perceiued that the Lord had called the childe.</ab>
<ab n="9">Therefore Eli
said vnto Samuel, Go, lie downe, &amp; it shal be, if he call thee,
that thou shalt say, Speake Lord, for thy seruant heareth. So
Samuel went, and lay downe in his place.</ab>
<ab n="10">And the Lord
came, and stood and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then
Samuel answered, Speake, for thy seruant heareth.</ab>
<ab n="11">¶ And the
Lord sayd to Samuel, Behold, I will doe a thing in Israel, at
which, both the eares of euery one that heareth it, shall
tingle.<note> 2.Kin.21. 12.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">In that day, I
will performe against Eli, all things which I haue spoken
concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an
end.<note> Hebr. beginning and ending.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">For I haue tolde
him, that I will iudge his house for euer, for the iniquitie which
hee knoweth: because his sonnes made themselues vile, and he
restrained them not.<note> Or, and I will tell him, &amp;c. , Chap.2. 29,30,31, &amp;c. , Or, accursed. , Heb. frowned not vpon them.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And therefore I
haue sworne vnto the house of Eli, that the iniquitie of Elies
house shall not be purged with sacrifice, nor offering for
euer.</ab>
<ab n="15">¶ And
Samuel lay vntill the morning, and opened the doores of the house
of the Lord: and Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.</ab>
<ab n="16">Then Eli called
Samuel, and said, Samuel my sonne. And he answered, Here am
I.</ab>
<ab n="17">And he said,
What is the thing that the Lord hath said vnto thee? I pray thee
hide it not from mee: God doe so to thee, and more also, if thou
hide any thing from me, of all the things that hee said vnto
thee.<note> Hebr. so adde. , Or, word.</note></ab>

<fw>Israel is ouercome.</fw>
<ab n="18">And Samuel tolde
him euery whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the
Lord: Let him doe what seemeth him good.<note> Heb all the things, or words.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">¶ And
Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his
words fall to the ground.</ab>
<ab n="20">And all Israel
from Dan euen to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established to
bee a Prophet of the Lord.<note> Or, faithfull.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">And the Lord
appeared againe in Shiloh: for the Lord reueiled himselfe to Samuel
in Shiloh, by the word of the Lord.</ab>
