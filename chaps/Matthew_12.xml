<head>CHAP.
XII.</head>
<head>1 Christ reprooueth the blindnesse
of the Pharisees concerning the breach of the Sabbath, 3 by
Scriptures, 9 by reason, 13 and by a miracle. 22 He healeth the man
possessed that was blind, and dumbe. 31 Blasphemie against the holy
Ghost shall neuer be forgiuen. 36 Account shalbe made of idle
words. 38 He rebuketh the vnfaithfull, who seeke after a signe: 49
and sheweth who is his brothe, sister, and mother.</head>

<ab n="1">At that time,
Iesus went on the Sabbath day thorow the corne, &amp; his Disciples
were an hungred, and beganne to pluck the eares of corne, and to
eate.<note> Marke 2. 23. luke 6. 1. deut. 23. 25</note></ab>
<ab n="2">But when the
Pharises saw it, they said vnto him, Behold, thy Disciples doe that
which is not lawfull to doe vpon the Sabbath day.</ab>
<ab n="3">But he said vnto
them, Haue yee not read what Dauid did when hee was an hungred, and
they that were with him,<note> 1.Sam. 21. 6</note></ab>

<fw>Many are healed.</fw>
<ab n="4">How he entred
into the house of God, and did eate the shew bread, which was not
lawfull for him to eate, neither for them which were with him, but,
only for the Priests?<note> Exod. 29. 33. leuit. 8. 31. and 24. 9.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">Or haue yee not
read in the law, how that on the Sabbath dayes the Priests in the
Temple profane the Sabbath, and are blamelesse?<note> Num. 28. 9.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">But I saye vnto
you, that in this place is one greater then the Temple.</ab>
<ab n="7">But if yee had
knowen what this meaneth, I will haue mercy, and not sacrifice, yee
would not haue condemned the guiltlesse.<note> Osee 6. 7. chap. 9. 13.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">For the sonne of
man is Lord euen of the Sabbath day.</ab>
<ab n="9">And when hee was
departed thence, he went into their Synagogue.<note> Marke 3. 1. Luke 6. 6.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">¶ And
behold, there was a man which had his hand withered, and they asked
him, saying, Is it lawfull to heale on the Sabbath dayes? that they
might accuse him.</ab>
<ab n="11">And hee said
vnto them, What man shal there be among you, that shall haue one
sheepe: and if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath day, will hee not
lay hold on it, and lift it out?</ab>
<ab n="12">How much then is
a man better then a shepe? Wherfore it is lawfull to doe well on
the Sabbath dayes.</ab>
<ab n="13">Then saith he to
the man, Stretch forth thine hand: and hee stretched it forth, and
it was restored whole, like as the other.</ab>
<ab n="14">¶ Then the
Pharises went out, and held a counsell against him, how they might
destroy him.<note> Or, tooke counsell.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">But when Iesus
knew it, hee withdrew himselfe from thence: and great multitudes
followed him, and he healed them all,</ab>
<ab n="16">And charged them
that they should not make him knowen:</ab>
<ab n="17">That it might be
fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet, saying,</ab>
<ab n="18">Behold, my
seruant whom I haue chosen, my beloued in whom my soule is well
pleased: I will put my spirit vpon him, and he shall shew iudgement
to the Gentiles.<note> Esai. 42. 1.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">He shall not
striue, nor cry, neither shall any man heare his voice in the
streets.</ab>
<ab n="20">A bruised reed
shal he not breake, and smoking flaxe shall he not quench, till he
send forth iudgment vnto victory.</ab>
<ab n="21">And in his name
shall the Gentiles trust.</ab>

<fw>The strong man.</fw>
<ab n="22">¶ Then was
brought vnto him one possessed with a deuill, blinde, and dumbe:
and hee healed him, insomuch that the blinde and dumbe both spake
and saw.<note> Luke 11.14.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">And all the
people were amazed, and said, Is this the sonne of Dauid?</ab>
<ab n="24">But when the
Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doeth not cast out
deuils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the deuils.<note> Cha.9.34</note></ab>
<ab n="25">And Iesus knew
their thoughts, and said vnto them, Euery kingdome diuided against
it selfe, is brought to desolation: and euery citie or house
diuided against it selfe, shall not stand.</ab>
<ab n="26">And if Satan
cast out Satan, he is diuided against himselfe; how shall then his
kingdome stand?</ab>
<ab n="27">And if I by
Beelzebub cast out deuils, by whom doe your children cast them out?
Therefore they shall be your Iudges.</ab>
<ab n="28">But if I cast
out deuils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdome of God is come
vnto you.</ab>
<ab n="29">Or else, how can
one enter into a strong mans house, &amp; spoile his goods, except
hee first binde the strong man, and then he will spoile his
house.</ab>
<ab n="30">He that is not
with me, is against me: and hee that gathereth not with me,
scattereth abroad.</ab>
<ab n="31">¶ Wherefore
I say vnto you, All maner of sinne and blasphemie shall be forgiuen
vnto men: but the blasphemie against the holy Ghost, shall not bee
forgiuen vnto men.<note> Mar.3.28. luke 12.10. 1. iohn 5.16.</note></ab>
<ab n="32">And whosoeuer
speaketh a word against the sonne of man, it shall be forgiuen him:
but whosoeuer speaketh against the holy Ghost, it shall not be
forgiuen him, neither in this world, neither in the world to
come.</ab>
<ab n="33">Either make the
tree good, and his fruit good: Or else make the tree corrupt, and
his fruit corrupt: For the tree is knowen by his fruit.</ab>
<ab n="34">O generation of
vipers, how can ye, being euil, speake good things? For out of the
abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.<note> Luke 6.45.</note></ab>
<ab n="35">A good man out
of the good treasure of the heart, bringeth foorth good things: and
an euill man out of the euill treasure, bringeth foorth euill
things.</ab>

<fw>Ionas a signe.</fw>
<ab n="36">But I say vnto
you, That euery idle word that men shall speake, they shall giue
accompt thereof in the day of Iudgement.</ab>
<ab n="37">For by thy
wordes thou shalt bee iustified, and by thy words thou shalt be
condemned.</ab>
<ab n="38">¶ Then
certaine of the Scribes, and of the Pharisees, answered, saying,
Master, we would see a signe from thee.<note> Chap.16.1. luke 11.29. 1.cor. 1.22.</note></ab>
<ab n="39">But hee
answered, and said to them, An euill and adulterous generation
seeketh after a signe, and there shall no signe be giuen to it, but
the signe of the Prophet Ionas.</ab>
<ab n="40">For as Ionas was
three dayes and three nights in the whales belly: so shal the sonne
of man be three daies and three nights in the heart of the
earth.<note> Iona.1.17.</note></ab>
<ab n="41">The men of
Nineue shall rise in iudgement with this generation, and shall
condemne it, because they repented at the preaching of Ionas, and
behold, a greater then Ionas is here.<note> Iona. 3.5.</note></ab>
<ab n="42">The Queene of
the South shall rise vp in the iudgement with this generation, and
shall condemne it: for she came from the vttermost parts of the
earth to heare the wisedome of Solomon, and behold, a greater then
Solomon is here.<note> 1.Kin.10.1.</note></ab>
<ab n="43">When the
vncleane spirit is gone out of a man, hee walketh thorow dry
places, seeking rest, and findeth none.<note> Luke 11.24.</note></ab>
<ab n="44">Then he saith, I
will returne into my house from whence I came out; And when he is
come, he findeth it emptie, swept, and garnished.</ab>
<ab n="45">Then goeth he,
and taketh with himselfe seuen other spirits more wicked then
himselfe, and they enter in and dwell there: And the last state of
that man is worse then the first. Euen so shal it be also vnto this
wicked generation.<note> Heb. 6.4. and 10.26. 2.pet.2.20.</note></ab>
<ab n="46">¶ While he
yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood
without, desiring to speake with him.<note> Mark.3.31. luke 8.20.</note></ab>
<ab n="47">Then one saide
vnto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without,
desiring to speake with thee.</ab>
<ab n="48">But he answered,
and said vnto him that told him, Who is my mother? And who are my
brethren?</ab>
<ab n="49">And hee
stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold, my
mother and my brethren.</ab>
<ab n="50">For whosoeuer
shall doe the will of my Father which is in heauen, the same is my
brother, and sister, and mother.</ab>
