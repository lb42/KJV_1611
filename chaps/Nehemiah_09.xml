<head>CHAP. IX.</head>
<head>1 A solemne Fast, and repentance of
the people. 4 The Leuites make a religious confession of Gods
goodnes, and their wickednes.</head>

<ab n="1">Now in the
twentie and fourth day of this moneth, the children of Israel were
assembled with fasting, &amp; with sackclothes, and earth vpon
them.<note> Chap.8.2</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And the seede of
Israel separated themselues from all strangers, and stood and
confessed their sinnes, and the iniquities of their
fathers.<note> Heb. strge children.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And they stood vp
in their place, and read in the booke of the Law of the Lord their
God, one fourth part of the day, and another fourth part they
confessed and worshipped the Lord their God.</ab>
<ab n="4">Â¶ Then
stoode vp, vpon the staires of the Leuites, Ieshua and Bani,
Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cryed
with a loude voice vnto the Lord their God.<note> Or, scaffold.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">Then the Leuites,
Ieshua and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodiiah,
Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, sayde, Stand vp, and blesse the Lord your
God for euer and euer, and blessed bee thy glorious Name, which is
exalted aboue all blessing and praise.</ab>
<ab n="6">Thou, euen thou
art Lord alone, thou hast made heauen, the heauen of heauens, with
all their hoste, the earth, and all things that are therein, the
seas, and all that is therin, and thou preseruest them all, and the
hoste of heauen worshippeth thee.<note> Gen.1.1.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">Thou art the Lord
the God, who diddest choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of
Ur of the Caldees, and gauest him the name of Abraham:<note> Gen.11. 31. and 12. 1. &amp;17.5.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">And foundest his
heart faithfull before thee, &amp; madest a couenant with him, to
giue the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and
the Perizzites, and the Iebusites, and the Girgashites, to giue it,
I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words, for thou art
righteous,<note> Gen.15.6. , Gen.12. 17. and 15. 18. &amp; 17.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And didst see the
affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the
red Sea,<note> Exod.3.7. and 14.10.</note></ab>

<fw>Gods benefits.</fw>
<ab n="10">And shewedst
signes and wonders vpon Pharaoh, and on all his seruants, and on
all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt
proudlie against them: so didst thou get thee a name, as it is this
day.<note> Exod.7.8, 9, 10, 12, &amp; 14. chapters</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And thou didst
diuide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of
the sea on the drie land, and their persecutours thou threwest into
the deepes, as a stone into the mightie waters.<note> Exod.14. 22. , Exod.15. 10.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">Moreouer thou
leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar, and in the night, by a
pillar of fire, to giue them light in the way wherin they should
go.<note> Exod.13. 21.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Thou camest
downe also vpon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heauen, and
gauest them right iudgements, and true lawes, good statutes and
commandements:<note> Exod.20.1 and 19. 20. , Heb. lawes of trueth.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And madest
knowen vnto them thy holy Sabbath, and commandedst them precepts,
statutes, and lawes, by the hand of Moses thy seruant:</ab>
<ab n="15">And gauest them
bread from heauen for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for
them out of the rocke, for their thirst, and promisedst them that
they should goe in to possesse the land, which thou hadst sworne to
giue them.<note> Exod. 16. 15. &amp; 17.6. num. 20.9. , Deut. 1.8 , Heb. which thou hadst lift vp thine hand to giue them.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">But they and our
fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkned not
to thy commandements:</ab>
<ab n="17">And refused to
obey, neither were mindful of the wonders that thou didst among
them: but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a
captaine to returne to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to
pardon, gracious and mercifull, slow to anger, and of great
kindnes, &amp; forsookest them not.<note> Num. 14. 4. , Heb. a god of pardons.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Yea when they
had made them a molten calfe, and said, This is thy God, that
brought thee vp out of Egypt, and had wrought great
prouocations:<note> Exo. 32.4</note></ab>
<ab n="19">Yet thou, in thy
manifold mercies, forsookest them not in the wildernesse: the
pillar of the cloude departed not from them by day, to leade them
in the way, neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them
light, and the way wherin they should goe.<note> Exod.13. 22. num.14 14. 1.cor. 10.1.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">Thou gauest also
thy good spirit, to instruct them, and withheldest not thy Manna
from their mouth, and gauest them water for their
thirst.<note> Num.11. 17. , Exod.16. 15. &amp; 17.6 iosh.5.12.</note></ab>

<fw>Mans ingratitude.</fw>
<ab n="21">Yea fourtie
yeeres diddest thou sustaine them in the wildernesse, so that they
lacked nothing; their clothes wared not old, and their feet swelled
not.<note> Deut.8.4</note></ab>
<ab n="22">Moreouer, thou
gauest them kingdomes and nations, and didst diuide them into
corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the
king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.<note> Num.21. 21, &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">Their children
also multipliedst thou as the starres of heauen, and broughtest
them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their
fathers, that they should goe in to possesse it.</ab>
<ab n="24">So the children
went in, and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the
inhabitants of the lande, the Canaanites, and gauest them into
their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that
they might doe with them, as they would.<note> Heb. according to their will.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">And they tooke
strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses ful of all
goods, welles digged, vineyards, and Olive yards, and fruit trees
in abundance: So they did eat and were filled, and became fat, and
delighted themselues in thy great goodnesse.<note> Or, cisternes , Heb. tree of foode.</note></ab>
<ab n="26">Neuerthelesse,
they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law
behind their backes, and slewe thy prophets, which testified
against them to turne them to thee, and they wrought great
prouocations.<note> 1.King.19 20.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">Therefore thou
deliueredst them into the hande of their enemies, who vexed them,
&amp; in the time of their trouble, when they cried vnto thee, thou
heardest them from heauen: and according to thy manifold mercies,
thou gauest them sauiours, who saued them out of the hand of their
enemies.</ab>
<ab n="28">But after they
had rest, they did euill againe before thee: therefore leftest thou
them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion
ouer them: yet when they returned and cried vnto thee, thou
heardest them from heauen, and many times didst thou deliuer them,
according to thy mercies:<note> Hebr. they returned to doe euill.</note></ab>
<ab n="29">And testifiedst
against them, that thou mightest bring them againe vnto thy lawe:
yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not vnto thy commaundements,
but sinned against thy iudgements, (which if a man doe, he shal
liue in them) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their necke,
and would not heare.<note> Heb. they gaue a withdrawing shoulder.</note></ab>

<fw>Who sealed the Couenant.</fw>
<ab n="30">Yet many yeres
diddest thou forbeare them, and testifiedst against them by the
Spirit in thy Prophets: yet would they not giue eare: therefore
gauest thou them into the hand of the people of the
lands.<note> Heb. protract ouer them. , 2.King. 17.13. 2. chr.36.15. , Heb. in the hand of thy Prophets.</note></ab>
<ab n="31">Neuerthelesse,
for thy great mercies sake, thou diddest not vtterly consume them,
nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and mercifull
God.</ab>
<ab n="32">Now therefore,
our God, the great, the mightie, and the terrible God, who keepest
couenant and mercie: let not all the trouble seeme little before
thee, that hath come vpon vs, on our Kings, on our Princes, &amp;
on our Priests, and on our Prophets, &amp; on our fathers, &amp; on
al thy people, since the time of the Kings of Assyria, vnto this
day.<note> Exo.34.6. , Hebr. wearinesse. , Heb. that hath found vs.</note></ab>
<ab n="33">Howbeit, thou
art iust in all that is brought vpon vs, for thou hast done right,
but we haue done wickedly:</ab>
<ab n="34">Neither haue our
kings, our Princes, our Priests, nor our fathers kept thy Law, nor
hearkened vnto thy Commandements, and thy Testimonies, wherewith
thou didst testifie against them.</ab>
<ab n="35">For they haue
not serued thee in their kingdome, and in thy great goodnesse that
thou gauest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gauest
before them, neither turned they from their wicked workes.</ab>
<ab n="36">Behold, we are
seruants this day; and for the land that thou gauest vnto our
fathers, to eat the fruit thereof, and the good thereof, behold,
wee are seruants in it.</ab>
<ab n="37">And it yeeldeth
much increase vnto the kings, whom thou hast set ouer vs, because
of our sinnes: also they haue dominion ouer our bodies, and ouer
our cattell, at their pleasure; and wee are in great
distresse.</ab>
<ab n="38">And because of
all this, wee make a sure couenant, and write it, and our Princes,
Leuites, and Priestes, seale vnto it.<note> Heb. are at the sealing, or sealed.</note></ab>
