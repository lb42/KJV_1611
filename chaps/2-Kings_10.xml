<ab n="1">And Ahab had
seuentie sonnes in Samaria: and Iehu wrote letters, and sent to
Samaria vnto the rulers of Iezreel, to the Elders, and to them that
brought vp Ahabs children, saying,<note> Heb. nourishers</note></ab>

<fw>Ahabs sonnes slaine.</fw>
<ab n="2">Now assoone as
this letter commeth to you, seeing your masters sons are with you,
and there are with you charets and horses, a fenced citie also, and
armour:</ab>
<ab n="3">Looke euen out
the best and meetest of your masters sonnes, and set him on his
fathers throne, and fight for your masters house.</ab>
<ab n="4">But they were
exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before
him: how then shall we stand?</ab>
<ab n="5">And he that was
ouer the house, and he that was ouer the citie, the elders also,
and the bringers vp of the children, sent to Iehu, saying, Wee are
thy seruants, and will doe all that thou shalt bid vs, we will not
make any king: doe thou that which is good in thine eyes.</ab>
<ab n="6">Then he wrote a
letter the second time to them, saying, If yee be mine, and if ye
will hearken vnto my voyce, take ye the heads of the men your
masters sonnes, and come to me to Iezreel by to morow this time:
(now the kings sonnes being seuenty persons, were with the great
men of the city, which brought them vp.)<note> Heb. for me.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">And it came to
passe when the letter came to them, that they tooke the kings
sonnes, and slewe seuentie persons, and put their heads in baskets,
and sent him them to Iezreel.</ab>
<ab n="8">¶ And there
came a messenger, and tolde him, saying, They haue brought the
heads of the kings sonnes. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at
the entring in of the gate, vntill the morning.</ab>
<ab n="9">And it came to
passe in the morning, that he went out, &amp; stood, and said to
all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired against my
master, and slew him: But who slew all these?</ab>
<ab n="10">Know now, that
there shall fall vnto the earth nothing of the worde of the Lord,
which the Lord spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the Lord
hath done that which he spake by his seruant Elijah.<note> 1.King. 21.29. , Heb. by the hand of.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">So Iehu slew all
that remained of the house of Ahab, in Iezreel, and all his great
men, and his kinsefolkes, and his priests, vntill he left him none
remaining.<note> Or, acquaintance.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">¶ And hee
arose, and departed, and came to Samaria: And as he was at the
shearing house in the way,<note> Heb. house of shepherds binding sheepe.</note></ab>

<fw>Iehu destroyeth Baals priests.</fw>
<ab n="13">Iehu met with
the brethren of Ahaziah king of Iudah, and said, Who are ye? And
they answered, Wee are the brethren of Ahaziah, and we go downe to
salute the children of the King, and the children of the
Queene.<note> Heb. found , Hebr. to the peace of &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And hee said,
Take them aliue. And they tooke them aliue, and slew them at the
pit of the shearing house, euen two and fourty men; neither left he
any of them.</ab>
<ab n="15">¶ And when
hee was departed thence, he lighted on Iehonadab the sonne of
Rechab, comming to meet him: and he saluted him, &amp; said to him,
Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Iehonadab
answered, It is: If it be, giue mee thine hand. And hee gaue him
his hand, and hee tooke him vp to him into the charet.<note> Hebr. found. , Hebr. blessed.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">And he said,
Come with me, and see my zeale for the Lord: so they made him ride
in his charet.</ab>
<ab n="17">And when he came
to Samaria, he slew all that remained vnto Ahab in Samaria, till he
had destroyed him, according to the saying of the Lord, which he
spake to Eliiah.</ab>
<ab n="18">¶ And Iehu
gathered all the people together, and said vnto them, Ahab serued
Baal a litle, but Iehu shall serue him much.</ab>
<ab n="19">Now therefore,
call vnto me all the prophets of Baal, all his seruants, and all
his priests, let none be wanting: for I haue a great sacrifice to
doe to Baal; whosoeuer shall be wanting, he shall not liue. But
Iehu did it in subtilitie, to the intent that hee might destroy the
worshippers of Baal.</ab>
<ab n="20">And Iehu said,
Proclaime a solemne assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed
it.<note> Hebr. sanctifie.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">And Iehu sent
through all Israel, and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that
there was not a man left that came not: and they came into the
house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to
another.<note> Or, so full, that they stood mouth to mouth.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">And he said vnto
him that was ouer the vestrie, Bring forth vestments for all the
worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.</ab>
<ab n="23">And Iehu went,
and Iehonadab the sonne of Rechab into the house of Baal, and said
vnto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and looke that there be here
with you none of the seruants of the Lord, but the worshippers of
Baal onely.</ab>

<fw>Iehu destroyeth Baals priests.</fw>
<ab n="24">And when they
went in to offer sacrifices, and burnt offerings, Iehu appointed
fourescore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I haue
brought into your hands, escape, hee that letteth him goe, his life
shall be for the life of him.</ab>
<ab n="25">And it came to
passe assoone as hee had made an end of offering the burnt
offering, that Iehu saide to the guard, and to the captaines, Goe
in, and slay them, let none come foorth. And they smote them with
the edge of the sword, and the guard, and the captaines cast them
out, and went to the citie of the house of Baal.<note> Hebr. the mouth.</note></ab>
<ab n="26">And they brought
foorth the Images out of the house of Baal, and burnt
them.<note> Hebr. statues.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">And they brake
downe the image of Baal, and brake downe the house of Baal, and
made it a draughthouse, vnto this day.</ab>
<ab n="28">Thus Iehu
destroyed Baal out of Israel.</ab>
<ab n="29">¶ Howbeit,
from the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, who made Israel to
sinne, Iehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calues
that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.</ab>
<ab n="30">And the Lord
said vnto Iehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which
is right in mine eyes, and hast done vnto the house of Ahab
according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth
generation, shal sit on the throne of Israel.</ab>
<ab n="31">But Iehu tooke
no heede to walke in the Law of the Lord God of Israel, with all
his heart: for he departed not from the sinnes of Ieroboam, which
made Israel to sinne.<note> Hebr. obserued not.</note></ab>
<ab n="32">¶ In those
dayes the Lord began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in
all the coasts of Israel:<note> Hebr. to cut off the ends.</note></ab>
<ab n="33">From Iordan
Eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites,
and the Manassites, from Aroer, (which is by the riuer Arnon) euen
Gilead and Bashan.<note> Hebr. toward the rising of the Sunne. , Or, euen to Gilead and Bashan.</note></ab>
<ab n="34">Now the rest of
the acts of Iehu, and all that he did, &amp; all his might, are
they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of
Israel?</ab>
<ab n="35">And Iehu slept
with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria, and Iehoahaz his
sonne reigned in his stead.</ab>

<fw>Athaliahs crueltie:</fw>
<ab n="36">And the time
that Iehu reigned ouer Israel in Samaria, was twentie and eight
yeeres.<note> Heb the dayes were.</note></ab>
