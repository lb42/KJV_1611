<head>CHAP. I.</head>
<head>1 All wisedome is from God. 10 He
giueth it to them that loue him. 12 The feare of God is full of
many blessings. 28 To feare God without hypocrisie.</head>

<ab n="1">[A Prologue
made by an vncertaine Authour.] This Iesus was the sonne of Sirach,
and grarul-childe to Iesus of the same name with him; This man
therefore liued in the latter times, after the people had bene led
away captiue, and called home againe, and almost after all the
Prophets. Now his grandfather Iesus (as he himselfe witnesseth) was
a man of great diligence and wisedome among the Hebrewes, who did
not onely gather the graue and short Sentences of wise men, that
had bene before him, but himselfe also vttered some of his owne,
full of much vnderstanding and wisedome. When as therefore the
first Iesus died, leauing this booke almost perfected, Si rach his
sonne receiuing it after him, left it to his owne sonne Iesus, who
hauing gotten it into his hands, compiled it all orderly into one
Volume, and called it Wisdome, Intituling it, both by his owne
name, his fathers name, and his grandfathers, alluring the hearer
by the very name of Wisedome, to haue a greater loue to the studie
of this Booke. It conteineth therefore wise Sayings, darke
Sentences, and Parables, and certaine particular ancient godly
stories of men that pleased God. Also his Prayer and Song.
Moreouer, what benefits God had vouchsafed his people, and what
plagues he had heaped vpon their enemies. This Iesus did imitate
Solomon, and was no lesse famous for Wisedome, and learning, both
being indeed a man of great learning, and so reputed also. [The
Prologue of the Wisdome of Jesus the sonne of Sirach] Whereas many
and great things haue bene deliuered vnto vs by the Law and the
Prophets, and by others that haue followed their steps, for the
which things Israel ought to be commended for learning and
Wisedome, and whereof not onely the Readers must needs become
skilful themselues, but also they that desire to learne, be able to
profit them which are without, both by speaking and writing : My
grandfather Iesus, when he had much giuen himselfe to the reading
of the Law, and the Prophets, and other Bookes of our fathers, and
had gotten therein good iudgement, was drawen on also himselfe, to
write something pertayning to learning and Wisedome, to the intent
that those which are desirous to learne, and are addicted to these
things, might profit much more in liuing according to the Law.
Wherefore, let me intreat you to reade it with fauour and
attention, and to pardon Vs, wherein wee may secme to come short of
some words which we haue laboured to interprete. For the same
things vttered in Hebrew, and translated into an other tongue, haue
not the same force in them : and not onely these things, but the
Law it selfe, and the Prophets, and the rest of the Bookes, haue no
small difference, when they are spoken in their owne language. For
in the eight and thirtieth yeere comming into Egypt, when Euergetes
was King, and continuing there some time, I found a Booke of no
small learning, therefore I thought it most necessary for mee, to
bestow some diligence and trauaile to interprete it: Vsing great
watchfulnesse, and skill in that space, to bring the Booke to an
end, and set it foorth for them also, which in a strange countrey
are willing to learne, being prepared before in maners to line
after the Law. [1] All wisedome commeth from the Lord, and is with
him for euer.<note> 1.Kings 3.9.</note></ab>
