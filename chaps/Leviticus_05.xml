<ab n="1">And if a soule

he hath seene or knowen of it, if he doe not vtter it, then he
shall beare his iniquity.</ab>
<ab n="2">Or if a soule

creeping things, and if it be hidden from him, he also shall be
vncleane, and guilty:</ab>
<ab n="3">Or if he touch
the vncleannesse of man, whatsoeuer vncleannesse it be that a man
shalbe defiled withall, and it be hid from him, when he knoweth of
it, then he shalbe guilty.</ab>
<ab n="4">Or if a soule
sweare, pronouncing with his lips to do euill, or to do good,
whatsoeuer it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be
hid from him, when he knoweth of it, then he shalbe guilty in one
of these.</ab>
<ab n="5">And it shalbe
when he shalbe guiltie in one of these things, that he shall
confesse that hee hath sinned in that thing.</ab>
<ab n="6">And he shall
bring his trespasse offering vnto the Lord for his sinne which he
hath sinned, a female from the flocke, a lambe, or a kidde of the
goates, for a sinne offering: And the Priest shal make an atonement
for him concerning his sinne.</ab>
<ab n="7">And if hee be
not able to bring a lambe, then he shall bring for his trespasse
which hee hath committed, two turtle doues, or two yong pigeons
vnto the Lord: one for a sinne offring, and the other for a burnt
offering.<note> Hebr. his hand cannot reach to the sufficiencie of a lambe.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">And he shall
bring them vnto the Priest, who shall offer that which is for the
sinne offering first, and wring off his head from his necke, but
shall not diuide it asunder.<note> Chap.1. 15.</note></ab>

<fw>Sinne of ignorance.</fw>
<ab n="9">And he shall
sprinckle of the blood of the sinne offering vpon the side of the
Altar, and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottome
of the altar: it is a sinne offering.</ab>
<ab n="10">And hee shall
offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the maner: and
the Priest shal make an atonement for him for his sinne, which he
had sinned, and it shall be forgiuen him.<note> Or, ordinance.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">¶ But if
hee be not able to bring two turtle doues, or two yong pigeons;
then he that sinned, shall bring for his offring the tenth part of
an Ephah of fine flowre for a sinne offering: hee shall put no oyle
vpon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a
sinne offering.</ab>
<ab n="12">Then shall hee
bring it to the Priest, and the Priest shall take his handfull of
it, euen a memoriall thereof, and burne it on the altar, according
to the offerings made by fire vnto the Lord: it is a sinne
offering.<note> Chap.2.2. , Chap. 4. 35.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">And the Priest
shall make an atonement for him as touching his sinne that he hath
sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiuen him: and the
remnant shall be the Priests, as a meat offering.</ab>
<ab n="14">¶ And the
Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,</ab>
<ab n="15">If a soule
commit a trespasse, and sinne through ignorance, in the holy things
of the Lord; then hee shall bring for his trespasse vnto the Lord,
a ramme without blemish, out of the flockes, with thy estimation by
shekels of siluer, after the shekel of the Sanctuarie, for a
trespasse offering.</ab>
<ab n="16">And hee shall
make amends for the harme that he hath done in the holy thing, and
shall adde the fift part thereto, and giue it vnto the Priest: and
the Priest shall make an atonement for him with the ramme of the
trespasse offering, and it shall be forgiuen him.</ab>
<ab n="17">¶ And if a
soule sinne, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to
be done by the commaundements of the Lord, though he wist it not,
yet is hee guiltie, and shall beare his iniquitie.<note> Chap.4.2.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">And he shall
bring a ramme without blemish out of the flocke, with thy
estimation, for a trespasse offering vnto the Priest: and the
Priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance
wherein he erred, and wist it not: and it shall be forgiuen
him.</ab>
<ab n="19">It is a
trespasse offring: he hath certainly trespassed against the
Lord.</ab>
