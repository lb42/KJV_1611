<head>1 Iosiah his good reigne. 3 He
destroyeth Idolatry. 8 Hee taketh order for the repaire of the
Temple. 14 Hilkiah hauing found a booke of the Law, Iosiah sendeth
to Huldah to inquire of the Lord. 23 Huldah prophecieth destruction
of Ierusalem, but respit therof in Iosiahs time. 29 Iosiah causing
it to be read in a solemne assembly, reneweth the couenant with
God.</head>


<fw>Iosiahs zeale.</fw>
<ab n="1">Iosiah was
eight yeeres old when hee beganne to reigne, and he reigned in
Ierusalem one and thirty yeeres.<note> 2. Kin.22. 1. &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And he did
that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the
wayes of Dauid his father, and declined neither to the right hand
nor to the left.</ab>
<ab n="3">¶ For
in the eight yeare of his reigne, while he was yet young, hee
beganne to seeke after the God of Dauid his father: and in the
twelfth yeere hee beganne to purge Iudah and Ierusalem from the
high places and the groues, and the carued images, and the molten
images.<note> 1.Kin. 13.2.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">And they
brake downe the altars of Baalim in his presence, and the images
that were on high aboue them, he cut downe, and the groues, and the
carued images, and the molten images he brake in peeces, and made
dust of them, and strowed it vpon the graues of them, that had
sacrificed vnto them.<note> Leuit.26. 20. , Or, sun-Images. , Heb. face of the graues.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">And hee
burnt the bones of the priests vpon their altars, and cleansed
Iudah and Ierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="6">And so did
he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, euen vnto
Naphtali, with their mattockes, round about.<note> Or, maules.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">And when he
had broken downe the altars and the groues, and had beaten the
grauen images into pouder, and cut downe all the idoles throughout
all the land of Israel, hee returned to Ierusalem.<note> Heb. to make pouder.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">¶ Now
in the eighteenth yeere of his reigne, when hee had purged the
land, and the house; he sent Shaphan the sonne of Azaliah, and
Maasiah the gouernour of the citie, and Ioah the sonne of Ioahaz
the recorder, to repaire the house of the Lord his God.</ab>

<fw>The Law found.</fw>
<ab n="9">And when
they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they deliuered the money that
was brought into the house of God, which the Leuites that kept the
doores, had gathered of the hand of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and of
all the remnant of Israel, and of all Iudah, and Beniamin, and they
returned to Ierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="10">And they
put it in the hand of the workemen that had the ouersight of the
house of the Lord, and they gaue it to the workemen that wrought in
the house of the Lord, to repaire and mend the house.</ab>
<ab n="11">Euen to the
artificers and builders gaue they it, to buy hewen stone, and
timber for couplings, and to floore the houses, which the kings of
Iudah had destroyed.<note> Or, to raster.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">And the men
did the worke faithfully, and the ouerseers of them were Iahath,
and Obadiah, the Leuites, of the sonnes of Merari, and Sechariah,
and Meshullam, of the sonnes of the Kohathites, to set it forward:
and other of the Leuites, all that could skill of instruments of
musicke.</ab>
<ab n="13">Also they
were ouer the bearers of burdens, and were ouerseers of all that
wrought the worke in any manner of seruice: and of the Leuites
there were Scribes, and officers, and porters.</ab>
<ab n="14">¶ And
when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of
the Lord, Hilkiah the priest found a booke of the lawe of the Lord,
giuen by Moses.<note> 2.Kings 22.8,&amp;c. , Heb. by the hand of.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">And Hilkiah
answered and saide to Shaphan the scribe: I haue found the booke of
the law in the house of the Lord. And Hilkiah deliuered the booke
to Shaphan:</ab>
<ab n="16">And Shaphan
caried the booke to the king, and brought the king word backe
againe, saying, All that was committed to thy seruants, they doe
it.<note> Heb. to the hand of.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">And they
haue gathered together the money that was found in the house of the
Lord, and haue deliuered it into the hand of the ouerseers, and to
the hand of the workemen.<note> Heb. powred out, or melted.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Then
Shaphan the scribe tolde the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath
giuen me a booke. And Shaphan read it before the king.<note> Heb. in it.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">And it came
to passe when the king had heard the words of the lawe, that he
rent his clothes.</ab>

<fw>Huldahs prophesie.</fw>
<ab n="20">And the
king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the sonne of Shaphan, and Abdon
the sonne of Mirah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a seruant of
the kings, saying,<note> Or, Achbor, 2.kings 22.12.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">Goe,
enquire of the Lord for me, and for them that are left in Israel
and in Iudah, concerning the wordes of the booke that is found: for
great is the wrath of the Lord that is powred out vpon vs, because
our fathers haue not kept the word of the Lord, to doe after all
that is written in this booke.</ab>
<ab n="22">And Hilkiah
and they that the king had appointed went to Huldah the
prophetesse, the wife of Shallum the sonne of Tikuath, the sonne of
Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Ierusalem in the
colledge,) and they spake to her to that effect.<note> Or, Harhas, 2.kings 22.14. , Heb. garments. , Or, in the schoole, or in the second part.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">¶ And
she answered them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Tell ye the
man that sent you to me,</ab>
<ab n="24">Thus saith
the Lord, behold, I will bring euill vpon this place, and vpon the
inhabitants thereof, euen all the curses that are written in the
booke which they haue read before the king of Iudah:</ab>
<ab n="25">Because
they haue forsaken mee, and haue burned incense vnto other gods,
that they might prouoke mee to anger with all the workes of their
hands, therefore my wrath shall bee powred out vpon this place, and
shall not be quenched.</ab>
<ab n="26">And as for
the king of Iudah, who sent you to enquire of the Lord, so shal ye
say vnto him: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, concerning the
words which thou hast heard:</ab>
<ab n="27">Because
thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thy selfe before God,
when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the
inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thy selfe before me, and diddest
rend thy clothes, and weepe before me, I haue euen heard thee also,
saith the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="28">Behold, I
will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt bee gathered to thy
graue in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the euill that I
will bring vpon this place, and vpon the inhabitants of the same.
So they brought the king word againe.</ab>
<ab n="29">¶ Then
the king sent, and gathered together all the Elders of Iudah and
Ierusalem.<note> 2.Kings 23.1.</note></ab>

<fw>Iosiah keepeth the Passeouer.</fw>
<ab n="30">And the
king went vp into the house of the Lord, and all the men of Iudah,
and the inhabitants of Ierusalem, and the priests and the Leuites,
and all the people great and small: and he read in their eares all
the words of the booke of the couenant, that was found in the house
of the Lord.<note> Heb. from great euen to small.</note></ab>
<ab n="31">And the
King stood in his place, &amp; made a Couenant before the Lord, to
walke after the Lord, and to keep his Commandements, and his
Testimonies, and his Statutes, with all his heart, &amp; with all
his soule, to performe the words of the Couenant which are written
in this booke.</ab>
<ab n="32">And he
caused all that were present in Ierusalem and Beniamin, to stand to
it. And the inhabitants of Ierusalem did according to the couenant
of God, the God of their fathers.<note> Heb. found.</note></ab>
<ab n="33">And Iosiah
tooke away all the abominations out of all the countreys that
perteined to the children of Israel, and made all that were present
in Israel to serue, euen to serue the Lord their God. And all his
dayes they departed not from folowing the Lord the God of their
fathers.<note> Heb. from after.</note></ab>
