<head>CHAP.
XIV.</head>
<head>1 The grieuous famine 7 causeth
Ieremiah to pray. 10 The Lord will not be intreated for the people.
13 Lying prophets are no excuse for them. 17 Ieremiah is mooued to
complaine for them.</head>


<fw>Prayer reiected.</fw>
<ab n="1">The word of the
Lord that came to Ieremiah concerning the dearth.<note> Heb. the words of the dearths or restraints.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">Iudah mourneth,
and the gates thereof languish, they are blacke vnto the ground,
and the crie of Ierusalem is gone vp.</ab>
<ab n="3">And their nobles
haue sent their litle ones to the waters, they came to the pits and
found no water, they returned with the vessels emptie: they were
ashamed and confounded, and couered their heads.</ab>
<ab n="4">Because the
ground is chapt, for there was no raine in the earth, the plowmen
were ashamed, they couered their heads.</ab>
<ab n="5">Yea the hinde
also calued in the field, and forsooke it, because there was no
grasse.</ab>
<ab n="6">And the wilde
asses did stand in the hie places, they snuffed vp the winde like
dragons: their eyes did faile because there was no grasse.</ab>
<ab n="7">¶ O Lord,
though our iniquities testifie against vs, doe thou it for thy
Names sake: for our back-slidings are many, we haue sinned against
thee.</ab>
<ab n="8">O the hope of
Israel, the Sauiour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou
be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man, that turneth
aside to tarie for a night?</ab>
<ab n="9">Why shouldest
thou bee as a man astonied, as a mightie man that cannot saue? yet
thou, O Lord, art in the midst of vs, and we are called by thy
Name, leaue vs not.<note> Hebr. thy Name is called vpon vs.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">¶ Thus
saith the Lord vnto this people, Thus haue they loued to wander,
they haue not refrained their feete, therefore the Lord doeth not
accept them, hee will now remember their iniquitie, and visite
their sinnes.</ab>
<ab n="11">Then said the
Lord vnto mee, Pray not for this people, for their
good.<note> Cha.7.16. and 11. 14. exod. 32.10</note></ab>
<ab n="12">When they fast
I will not heare their crie, and when they offer burnt offering and
an oblation I wil not accept them: but I will consume them by the
sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.<note> Prou.1.28 isa.1.15. cha.11. 11. ezek. 8.18. mic. 3.4.</note></ab>

<fw>False prophets.</fw>
<ab n="13">¶ Then
said I Ah Lord God, behold, the prophets say vnto them; Ye shall
not see the sword, neither shall ye haue famine, but I will giue
you assured peace in this place.<note> Hebr peace of trueth.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">Then the Lord
said vnto me, The prophets prophecie lies in my Name, I sent them
not, neither haue I commanded them, neither spake vnto them: they
prophecie vnto you a false vision and diuination, and a thing of
nought, and the deceit of their heart.<note> Chap.23. 21. and 27. 15. and 29. 8, 9.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">Therefore thus
saith the Lord concerning the prophets that prophecie in my Name,
and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in
this land, By sword and famine shall those prophets be
consumed.</ab>
<ab n="16">And the people
to whom they prophecie, shall be cast out in the streets of
Ierusalem, because of the famine and the sword, and they shall haue
none to burie them, them, their wiues, nor their sonnes, nor their
daughters: for I will powre their wickednesse vpon them.</ab>
<ab n="17">¶
Therefore thou shalt say this word vnto them, Let mine eies runne
downe with teares night and day, and let them not cease, for the
virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a
very grieuous blow.<note> Lam. 1. 16. and 2. 18. chap. 13. 17.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">If I goe forth
into the field, then behold the slaine with the sword, and if I
enter into the citie, then behold them that are sicke with famine,
yea both the prophet and the priest goe about into a land that they
know not.<note> Or, make merchandise against a land, and men acknowledge it not, Chap. 5. 31.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">Hast thou
vtterly reiected Iudah? hath thy soule loathed Zion? why hast thou
smitten vs, and there is no healing for vs? we looked for peace,
and there is no good, and for the time of healing, and behold
trouble.<note> Chap. 8. 15.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">We acknowledge,
O Lord, our wickednes, and the iniquitie of our fathers: for wee
haue sinned against thee.<note> Psal. 106. 6. dan.9.8.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">Do not abhorre
vs, for thy Names sake, doe not disgrace the Throne of thy glorie:
remember, breake not thy Couenant with vs.</ab>
<ab n="22">Are there any
among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause raine? or can the
heauens giue showres, Art not thou he, O Lord our God? therefore we
will waite vpon thee: for thou hast made all these things.</ab>
