backe all the goods, and also brought againe his brother Lot, and
his goods, and the women also, and the people.</ab>

the valley of Saueh, which is the Kings dale.<note> 2.Sam.18. 18.</note></ab>

take from a threed euen to a shoe latchet, and that I will not take

which the yong men haue eaten, and the portion of the men which
went with mee, Aner, Eschol, and Mamre; let them take their
portion.</ab>
