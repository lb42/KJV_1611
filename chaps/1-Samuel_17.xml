brought to Saul. 32 He sheweth the reason of his confidence. 38
Without armour, armed by faith, he slayeth the Giant. 55 Saul
taketh notice of Dauid.</head>


<fw>Goliath defieth the armies of
Israel.</fw>
<ab n="1">Now the
Philistines gathered together their armies to battell, and were
gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Iudah, and pitched
betweene Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-Dammim.<note> Or, the coast of Dammim.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And Saul and the
men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of
Elah, and set the battell in aray against the
Philistines.<note> Heb. ranged the battell.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And the
Philistines stood on a mountaine on the one side, and Israel stood
on a mountaine on the other side: and there was a valley betweene
them.</ab>
<ab n="4">¶ And there
went out a champion out of the campe of the Philistines, named
Goliath of Gath: whose height was sixe cubites and a span.</ab>
<ab n="5">And he had an
helmet of brasse vpon his head, and he was armed with a coate of
male: and the weight of the coat was fiue thousand shekels of
brasse.<note> Heb. cloathed.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">And he had
greaues of brasse vpon his legs, and a target of brasse betweene
his shoulders.<note> Or, gorget.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">And the staffe
of his speare was like a weauers beame, and his speares head
weighed sixe hundred shekels of yron: and one bearing a shield,
went before him.</ab>
<ab n="8">And hee stood
and cried vnto the armies of Israel, and said vnto them, Why are
yee come out to set your battell in aray? am not I a Philistine,
and you seruants to Saul? chuse you a man for you, and let him come
downe to me.</ab>
<ab n="9">If he be able to
fight with mee, and to kill me, then will we be your seruants: but
if I preuaile against him, and kill him, then shall yee be our
seruants, and serue vs.</ab>
<ab n="10">And the
Philistine said, I defie the armies of Israel this day; giue me a
man, that we may fight together.</ab>
<ab n="11">When Saul and
all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed,
and greatly afraid.</ab>
<ab n="12">¶ Now
Dauid was the sonne of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Iudah, whose
name was Iesse, and hee had eight sonnes: and the man went among
men for an old man in the dayes of Saul.<note> Chap. 16.1.</note></ab>

<fw>Goliath defieth the armies of
Israel.</fw>
<ab n="13">And the three
eldest sonnes of Iesse went, and followed Saul to the battell: and
the names of his three sonnes that went to the battell, were, Eliab
the first borne, and next vnto him, Abinadab, and the third,
Shammah.</ab>
<ab n="14">And Dauid was
the yongest: and the three eldest followed Saul.</ab>
<ab n="15">But Dauid went,
and returned from Saul, to feed his fathers sheepe at
Bethlehem.</ab>
<ab n="16">And the
Philistine drewe neere, morning and euening, and presented himselfe
forty dayes.</ab>
<ab n="17">And Iesse said
vnto Dauid his sonne, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this
parched corne, and these ten loaues, and run to the campe to thy
brethren.</ab>
<ab n="18">And carie these
ten cheeses vnto the Captaine of their thousand, and looke how thy
brethren fare, and take their pledge.<note> Heb. cheeses of milke. , Heb. captaine of a thousand.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">Now Saul, and
they, and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah,
fighting with the Philistines.</ab>
<ab n="20">¶ And
Dauid rose vp earely in the morning, and left the sheepe with a
keeper, and tooke, and went, as Iesse had commanded him; and he
came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and
shouted for the battell.<note> Or, place of the cariage. , Or, battell ray, or place of fight.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">For Israel and
the Philistines had put the battel in aray, army against
armie.</ab>
<ab n="22">And Dauid left
his cariage in the hand of the keeper of the cariage, and ranne
into the armie, and came and saluted his brethren.<note> Hebr. the vessels from vpon him. , Heb. asked his brethren of peace.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">And as he
talked with them, behold, there came vp the champion (the
Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name) out of the armies of the
Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and Dauid heard
them.</ab>
<ab n="24">And all the men
of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore
afraid.<note> Heb. from his face.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">And the men of
Israel said, Haue yee seene this man that is come vp? Surely to
defie Israel is he come vp: and it shall be that the man who
killeth him, the king wil enrich him with great riches, and will
giue him his daughter, and make his fathers house free in
Israel.<note> Iosh.15. 16.</note></ab>

<fw>Dauids faith: He killeth
Goliath.</fw>
<ab n="26">And Dauid spake
to the men that stood by him, saying; What shall bee done to the
man that killeth this Philistine; and taketh away the reproch from
Israel? for who is this vncircumcised Philistine, that he should
defie the armies of the liuing God?</ab>
<ab n="27">And the people
answered him after this maner, saying, So shall it be done to the
man that killeth him.</ab>
<ab n="28">¶ And
Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake vnto the men, and
Eliabs anger was kindled against Dauid, and he said, Why camest
thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheepe in
the wildernesse? I know thy pride, and the naughtinesse of thine
heart; for thou art come downe, that thou mightest see the
battell.</ab>
<ab n="29">And Dauid
saide, What haue I now done? Is there not a cause?</ab>
<ab n="30">¶ And hee
turned from him towards another, and spake after the same maner:
and the people answered him againe after the former
maner.<note> Hebr. word.</note></ab>
<ab n="31">And when the
words were heard which Dauid spake, they rehearsed them before
Saul: and he sent for him.<note> Heb. tooke him.</note></ab>
<ab n="32">¶ And
Dauid said to Saul, Let no mans heart faile, because of him: thy
seruant will goe and fight with this Philistine.</ab>
<ab n="33">And Saul said
to Dauid, Thou art not able to goe against this Philistine, to
fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of warre
from his youth.</ab>
<ab n="34">And Dauid said
vnto Saul, Thy seruant kept his fathers sheepe, and there came a
Lyon, and a Beare, and tooke a lambe out of the flocke:<note> Or, kid.</note></ab>
<ab n="35">And I went out
after him, and smote him, and deliuered it out of his mouth: and
when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him,
and slew him.</ab>
<ab n="36">Thy seruant
slew both the Lyon and the Beare: and this vncircumcised Philistine
shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the
liuing God.</ab>
<ab n="37">Dauid saide
moreouer, The Lord that deliuered me out of the paw of the Lyon,
and out of the pawe of the Beare, he will deliuer me out of the
hand of this Philistine. And Saul said vnto Dauid, Goe, and the
Lord be with thee.</ab>
<ab n="38">¶ And Saul
armed Dauid with his armour, and hee put an helmet of brasse vpon
his head, also he armed him with a coat of male.<note> Heb. cloathed, &amp;c. with his cloathes.</note></ab>

<fw>He killeth Goliath.</fw>
<ab n="39">And Dauid
girded his sword vpon his armour, and he assayed to goe, for he had
not proued it: and Dauid said vnto Saul, I cannot goe with these:
for I haue not proued them. And Dauid put them off him.</ab>
<ab n="40">And hee tooke
his staffe in his hand, and chose him fiue smoothe stones out of
the brooke, and put them in a shepheards bag which he had, euen in
a scrip, and his sling was in his hande, and he drew neere to the
Philistine.<note> Or, valley. , Heb. vessell.</note></ab>
<ab n="41">And the
Philistine came on and drew neere vnto Dauid, and the man that bare
the shield, went before him.</ab>
<ab n="42">And when the
Philistine looked about, and saw Dauid, hee disdained him: for he
was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a faire countenance.</ab>
<ab n="43">And the
Philistine said vnto Dauid, Am I a dog, that thou commest to me
with staues? and the Philistine cursed Dauid by his gods.</ab>
<ab n="44">And the
Philistine said to Dauid, Come to me, and I will giue thy flesh
vnto the foules of the aire, and to the beasts of the
field.</ab>
<ab n="45">Then said Dauid
to the Philistine, Thou commest to mee with a sword, and with a
speare, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the Name of the
Lord of hostes, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast
defied.</ab>
<ab n="46">This day wil
the Lord deliuer thee into mine hand, and I will smite thee, and
take thine head from thee, and I wil giue the carkeises of the host
of the Philistines this day vnto the foules of the aire, and to the
wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is
a God in Israel.<note> Hebr. sent thee vp.</note></ab>
<ab n="47">And all this
assembly shal know that the Lord saueth not with sword &amp; speare
(for the battell is the Lords ) and he will giue you into our
hands.</ab>
<ab n="48">And it came to
passe when the Philistine arose, and came, and drewe nigh to meet
Dauid, that Dauid hasted, and ran toward the armie to meete the
Philistine.</ab>
<ab n="49">And Dauid put
his hande in his bag, and tooke thence a stone, and slang it, &amp;
smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunke into his
forehead, and he fell vpon his face to the earth.</ab>
<ab n="50">So Dauid
preuailed ouer the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and
smote the Philistine, and slew him, but there was no sword in the
hande of Dauid.<note> Ecclus. 47.4. 1. macc.4.30.</note></ab>

<fw>Ionathans loue to Dauid.</fw>
<ab n="51">Therefore Dauid
ran and stood vpon the Philistine, and tooke his sword, and drewe
it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head
therewith. And when the Philistines sawe their champion was dead,
they fled.</ab>
<ab n="52">And the men of
Israel, and of Iudah arose, and shouted, and pursued the
Philistines, vntill thou come to the valley, and to the gates of
Ekron: and the wounded of the Philistines fell downe by the way to
Shaaraim, euen vnto Gath, and vnto Ekron.</ab>
<ab n="53">And the
children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and
they spoiled their tents.</ab>
<ab n="54">And Dauid tooke
the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Ierusalem, but he put
his armour in his tent.</ab>
<ab n="55">¶ And when
Saul sawe Dauid goe forth against the Philistine, he sayd vnto
Abner the captaine of the hoste, Abner, whose sonne is this youth?
And Abner said, As thy soule liueth, O king, I cannot tell.</ab>
<ab n="56">And the king
said, Enquire thou whose sonne the stripling is.</ab>
<ab n="57">And as Dauid
returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner tooke him,
&amp; brought him before Saul, with the head of the Philistine in
his hand.</ab>
<ab n="58">And Saul saide
to him, Whose sonne art thou, thou yong man? And Dauid answered, I
am the sonne of thy seruant Iesse, the Bethlehemite.</ab>
