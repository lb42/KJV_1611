<ab n="1">And Moses
went &amp; spake these wordes vnto all Israel.</ab>
<ab n="2">And hee saide
vnto them, I am an hundred and twentie yeeres old this day; I can
no more goe out and come in: also the Lord hath said vnto mee, Thou
shalt not goe ouer this Iordan.<note> Num. 20. 12. chap.3. 27.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">The Lord thy
God, hee will goe ouer before thee, and he will destroy these
nations from before thee, and thou shalt possesse them: and Ioshua,
hee shall goe ouer before thee, as the Lord hath said.<note> Num.27. 21.</note></ab>

<fw>Ioshua incouraged.</fw>
<ab n="4">And the Lord
shall doe vnto them, as hee did to Sihon, and to Og Kings of the
Amorites, and vnto the land of them, whom he destroyed.</ab>
<ab n="5">And the Lord
shall giue them vp before your face, that ye may doe vnto them
according vnto all the Commandements which I haue commanded
you.<note> Chap.7.2.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">Be strong,
and of a good courage, feare not, nor be afraid of them: for the
Lord thy God, he it is that doeth goe with thee, he will not faile
thee, nor forsake thee.</ab>
<ab n="7">¶ And
Moses called vnto Ioshua, and said vnto him in the sight of all
Israel, Bee strong, and of a good courage: for thou must goe with
this people vnto the land, which the Lord hath sworne vnto their
fathers to giue them; and thou shalt cause them to inherite
it.</ab>
<ab n="8">And the Lord,
he it is that doth goe before thee, he will be with thee, hee will
not faile thee, neither forsake thee: feare not, neither be
dismayed.</ab>
<ab n="9">¶ And
Moses wrote this Law, and deliuered it vnto the Priests the sonnes
of Leui, which bare the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord, and vnto
all the Elders of Israel.</ab>
<ab n="10">And Moses
commanded them, saying, At the end of euery seuen yeeres, in the
solemnitie of the yeere of release, in the feast of
Tabernacles,<note> Chap.15. 1.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">When all
Israel is come to appeare before the Lord thy God, in the place
which hee shall choose; thou shalt reade this Law before all
Israel, in their hearing.</ab>
<ab n="12">Gather the
people together, men, and women and children, and thy stranger that
is within thy gates, that they may heare, and that they may learne,
and feare the Lord your God, and obserue to doe all the wordes of
this Law:</ab>
<ab n="13">And that
their children which haue not knowen any thing, may heare, and
learne to feare the Lord your God, as long as yee liue in the land,
whither ye goe ouer Iordan to possesse it.</ab>
<ab n="14">¶ And
the Lord saide vnto Moses, Beholde, thy dayes approach that thou
must die: call Ioshua, and present your selues in the Tabernacle of
the Congregation, that I may giue him a charge. And Moses and
Ioshua went and presented themselues in the Tabernacle of the
Congregation.</ab>

<fw>Ioshuas charge.</fw>
<ab n="15">And the Lord
appeared in the Tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar
of the cloude stood ouer the doore of the Tabernacle.</ab>
<ab n="16">¶ And
the Lord saide vnto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleepe with thy
fathers, and this people wil rise vp, and goe a whoring after the
gods of the strangers of the land whither they goe to be amongst
them, and wil forsake me, and breake my couenant which I haue made
with them.<note> Hebr. lye downe.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">Then my
anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake
them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be
deuoured, and many euils and troubles shall befall them, so that
they will say in that day, Are not these euils come vpon vs,
because our God is not amongst vs?<note> Hebr. finde them.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">And I will
surely hide my face in that day, for all the euils which they shal
haue wrought, in that they are turned vnto other gods.</ab>
<ab n="19">Now
therefore, write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of
Israel: put it in their mouthes, that this song may be a witnesse
for mee, against the children of Israel.</ab>
<ab n="20">For when I
shall haue brought them into the land which I sware vnto their
fathers, that floweth with milke and hony; and they shall haue
eaten and filled themselues, and waxen fat; then will they turne
vnto other gods, and serue them, and prouoke me, and breake my
couenant.</ab>
<ab n="21">And it shall
come to passe, when many euils and troubles are befallen them, that
this song shall testifie against them as a witnesse: for it shall
not bee forgotten out of the mouthes of their seed: for I know
their imagination which they goe about euen now, before I haue
brought them into the land, which I sware.<note> Hebr. before. , Hebr. doe.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">¶ Moses
therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children
of Israel.</ab>
<ab n="23">And he gaue
Ioshua the sonne of Nun a charge, and said, Bee strong, and of a
good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the
land which I sware vnto them: and I will be with thee.<note> Iosh.1,6.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">¶ And
it came to passe when Moses had made an ende of writing the wordes
of this Law in a booke, vntill they were finished,</ab>

<fw>Moses song.</fw>
<ab n="25">That Moses
commaunded the Leuites which bare the Arke of the Couenant of the
Lord, saying,</ab>
<ab n="26">Take this
booke of the Law, and put it in the side of the Arke of the
Couenant of the Lord your God, that it may bee there for a witnesse
against thee.</ab>
<ab n="27">For I know
thy rebellion, and thy stiffe necke: Beholde, while I am yet aliue
with you this day, yee haue bene rebellious against the Lord; and
how much more after my death?</ab>
<ab n="28">¶
Gather vnto mee all the Elders of your tribes, and your Officers,
that I may speake these words in their eares, and call heauen and
earth to record against them.</ab>
<ab n="29">For I know,
that after my death yee will vtterly corrupt your selues, and turne
aside from the way, which I haue commauded you: and euil wil befall
you in the latter dayes, because yee wil doe euil in the sight of
the Lord, to prouoke him to anger through the worke of your
hands.</ab>
<ab n="30">And Moses
spake in the eares of al the Cōgregation of Israel the words
of this song, vntill they were ended.</ab>
