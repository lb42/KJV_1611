<head>CHAP.
XII.</head>
<head>1 Rehoboam forsaking the Lord, is
punished by Shishak. 5 He and the Princes repenting at the
preaching of Shemaiah, are deliuered from destruction, but not from
spoile. 13 The reigne and death of Rehoboam.</head>

<ab n="1">And it came
to passe when Rehoboam had established the kingdome, and had
strengthened himselfe, hee forsooke the Law of the Lord, and all
Israel with him.</ab>
<ab n="2">And it came
to passe, that in the fifth yere of Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt
came vp against Ierusalem, ( because they had transgressed against
the Lord )<note> 1.King. 14.24. and 25.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">With twelue
hundred charets, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people
were without number that came with him out of Egypt: the Lubims,
the Sukkiims, &amp; the Ethiopians.</ab>
<ab n="4">And hee
tooke the fenced cities which perteined to Iudah, and came to
Ierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="5">¶ Then
came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the Princes of Iudah
that were gathered together to Ierusalem because of Shishak, and
said vnto them, Thus saith the Lord, Ye haue forsaken me, and
therfore haue I also left you in the hand of Shishak.</ab>
<ab n="6">Whereupon,
the Princes of Israel, and the king humbled themselues and they
saide, The Lord is righteous.</ab>
<ab n="7">And when the
Lord saw that they humbled themselues, the word of the Lord came to
Shemaiah, saying, They haue humbled themselues, therefore I will
not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliuerance, and my
wrath shall not bee powred out vpon Ierusalem, by the hand of
Shishak.<note> Or, a litle while.</note></ab>

<fw>His death, and successour.</fw>
<ab n="8">Neuerthelesse
they shalbe his seruants, that they may know my seruice, and the
seruice of the kingdomes of the countreys.</ab>
<ab n="9">So Shishak
king of Egypt came vp against Ierusalem, and tooke away the
treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the kings
house, hee tooke all: he caried away also the shields of gold,
which Solomon had made.<note> Cha.9.15</note></ab>
<ab n="10">In stead of
which, king Rehoboam made shields of brasse, and committed them to
the hands of the chiefe of the guard, that kept the entrance of the
Kings house.</ab>
<ab n="11">And when
the king entred into the house of the Lord, the guard came and fet
them, and brought them againe into the guard-chamber.</ab>
<ab n="12">And when he
humbled himselfe, the wrath of the Lord turned from him, that hee
would not destroy him altogether: and also in Iudah things went
well.<note> Or, and yet in Iudah there were good things.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">¶ So
king Rehoboam strengthened himselfe in Ierusalem, and reigned: for
Rehoboam was one and fourty yeeres olde when hee began to reigne,
and he reigned seuenteen yeeres in Ierusalem, the citie which the
Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his Name
there: and his mothers name was Naamah an Ammonitesse.<note> 1.King. 14.21.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And hee did
euill, because hee prepared not his heart to seeke the
Lord.<note> Or, fixed.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">Now the
acts of Rehoboam first and last, are they not written in the booke
of Shemaiah the Prophet, and of Iddo the Seer, concerning
genealogies? and there were warres betweene Rehoboam &amp; Ieroboam
continually.<note> Heb. words</note></ab>
<ab n="16">And
Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the citie of
Dauid, and Abiiah his sonne reigned in his stead.</ab>
