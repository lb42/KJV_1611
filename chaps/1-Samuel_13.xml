<fw>Sauls presumption.</fw>
<ab n="1">Saul reigned one
yeere, and when he had reigned two yeeres ouer Israel,<note> Hebr. the sonne of one yeere in his reigning.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">Saul chose him
three thousand men of Israel: whereof two thousand were with Saul
in Michmash, and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Ionathan
in Gibeah of Beniamin: and the rest of the people he sent euery man
to his tent.</ab>
<ab n="3">And Ionathan
smote the garison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the
Philistines heard of it: and Saul blew the trumpet thorowout all
the land, saying, Let the Hebrewes heare.<note> Or, the hill.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">And all Israel
heard say, that Saul had smitten a garison of the Philistines, and
that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines: and
the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.<note> Hebr. did stinke.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">¶ And the
Philistines gathered themselues together, to fight with Israel,
thirtie thousand charets, and sixe thousand horsemen, and people as
the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude, and they came vp,
and pitched in Michmash, Eastward from Bethauen.</ab>
<ab n="6">When the men of
Israel saw that they were in a strait: (for the people were
distressed:) then the people did hide themselues in caues, and in
thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.</ab>
<ab n="7">And some of the
Hebrewes went ouer Iordane, to the land of Gad and Gilead; as for
Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him
trembling.<note> Hebr. trembled after him.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">¶ And he
taried seuen dayes, according to the set time that Samuel had
appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal, and the people were
scattered from him.<note> Chap. 10. 8.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And Saul said,
Bring hither a burnt offring to me, and peace offrings. And he
offered the burnt offering.</ab>
<ab n="10">And it came to
passe that assoone as he had made an end of offering the burnt
offering, behold, Samuel came, and Saul went out to meete him, that
he might salute him.<note> Heb. blesse him.</note></ab>

<fw>He is reproued.</fw>
<ab n="11">¶ And
Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I sawe
that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not
within the dayes appointed, and that the Philistines gathered
themselues together to Michmash:</ab>
<ab n="12">Therfore said
I, The Philistines will come downe now vpon me to Gilgal, and I
haue not made supplication vnto the Lord: I forced my selfe
therefore, and offered a burnt offering.<note> Hebr. intreated the face.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">And Samuel said
to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the
commandement of the Lord thy God, which hee commanded thee: for now
would the Lord haue established thy kingdome vpon Israel for
euer.</ab>
<ab n="14">But now thy
kingdome shall not continue: the Lord hath sought him a man after
his owne heart, and the Lord hath commanded him to bee captaine
ouer his people, because thou hast not kept that which the Lord
commanded thee.</ab>
<ab n="15">And Samuel
arose, and gate him vp from Gilgal, vnto Gibeah of Beniamin, and
Saul numbred the people that were present with him, about sixe
hundred men.<note> Heb. found</note></ab>
<ab n="16">And Saul and
Ionathan his sonne, and the people that were present with them,
abode in Gibeah of Beniamin: but the Philistines encamped in
Michmash.</ab>
<ab n="17">¶ And the
spoilers came out of the campe of the Philistines, in three
companies: one company turned vnto the way that leadeth to Ophrah,
vnto the land of Shual.</ab>
<ab n="18">And another
company turned the way to Bethoron: and another companie turned to
the way of the border, that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward
the wildernesse.</ab>
<ab n="19">¶ Now
there was no smith found thorowout all the land of Israel: for the
Philistines said, Lest the Hebrewes make them swords or
speares.</ab>
<ab n="20">But all the
Israelites went downe to the Philistines, to sharpen euery man his
share and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattocke.</ab>
<ab n="21">Yet they had a
file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forkes,
and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.<note> Hebr. a file with mouthes. , Heb. to set.</note></ab>

<fw>Ionathan and his armour-bearer:</fw>
<ab n="22">So it came to
passe in the day of battell, that there was neither sword nor
speare found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul
and Ionathan: but with Saul &amp; with Ionathan his sonne was there
found.</ab>
<ab n="23">And the garison
of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.<note> Or, standing campe.</note></ab>
