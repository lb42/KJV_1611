<head>CHAP.
III.</head>
<head>1 Gods great mercy in Iudahs vile
whoredome. 6 Iudah is worse then Israel. 12 The promises of the
Gospel, to the penitent. 20 Israel reprooued and called by God,
maketh a solemne confession of their sinnes.</head>

<ab n="1">They say; If a
man put away his wife, and she goe from him, and become another
mans, shall hee returne vnto her againe? shall not that land be
greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many louers;
yet returne againe to me, saith the Lord.<note> Heb. saying. , Deu.24.4</note></ab>
<ab n="2">Lift vp thine
eyes vnto the high places, and see where thou hast not bene lien
with: in the wayes hast thou sate for them, as the Arabian in the
wildernesse, and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredomes,
and with thy wickednes.</ab>
<ab n="3">Therefore the
showres haue bin withholden, and there hath bene no latter raine,
and thou haddest a whores forehead, thou refusedst to be
ashamed.<note> Deut.28.24. chap.9. 12. , Cha.6.15.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">Wilt thou not
from this time cry vnto me; My father, thou art the guide of my
youth?</ab>
<ab n="5">Will he reserue
his anger for euer? wil he keepe it to the end? Behold, thou hast
spoken and done euill things as thou couldest.</ab>
<ab n="6">¶ The Lord
said also vnto me, in the daies of Iosiah the king, Hast thou seene
that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone vp vpon euery
high mountaine, and vnder euery greene tree, and there hath plaied
the harlot.<note> Cha.2.20.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">And I said after
she had done all these things; Turne thou vnto me: but shee
returned not, and her treacherous sister Iudah saw it.</ab>
<ab n="8">And I saw, when
for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adulterie,
I had put her away and giuen her a bill of diuorce: yet her
treacherous sister Iudah feared not, but went and played the harlot
also.</ab>
<ab n="9">And it came to
passe thorow the lightnes of her whoredome, that shee defiled the
land, and committed adultery with stones and with
stockes.<note> Or, fame.</note></ab>

<fw>God calleth to repentance.</fw>
<ab n="10">And yet for all
this her treacherous sister Iudah hath not turned vnto mee with her
whole heart, but fainedly, saith the Lord.<note> Hebr. in falshood.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And the Lord
said vnto mee, The backesliding Israel hath iustified her selfe
more then treacherous Iudah.</ab>
<ab n="12">¶ Go and
proclaime these words toward the North, and say, Returne thou
backesliding Israel, sayeth the Lord, and I will not cause mine
anger to fall vpon you: for I am mercifull, saith the Lord, and I
will not keepe anger for euer.<note> Psal.86. 15. and 103 8,9.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Only acknowledge
thine iniquity that thou hast transgressed against the Lord thy
God, and hast scattered thy wayes to the strangers vnder euery
greene tree, and ye haue not obeyed my voice, saith the
Lord.</ab>
<ab n="14">Turne, O
backesliding children, saith the Lord, for I am maried vnto you:
and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I wil
bring you to Zion.</ab>
<ab n="15">And I will giue
you Pastours according to mine heart, which shall feede you with
knowledge and vnderstanding.<note> Cha.23.4.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">And it shall
come to passe when yee bee multiplied and increased in the land; in
those dayes, saith the Lord, they shal say no more; The Arke of the
Couenant of the Lord: neither shal it come to minde, neither shall
they remember it, neither shall they visit it, neither shall that
be done any more.<note> Heb. come vp on the heart. , Or, it be magnified.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">At that time
they shall call Ierusalem the Throne of the Lord, and all the
nations shalbe gathered vnto it, to the Name of the Lord, to
Ierusalem: neither shall they walke any more after the imagination
of their euill heart.<note> Or, stubburnnesse.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">In those dayes
the house of Iudah shall walke with the house of Israel, and they
shall come together out of the land of the North to the land that I
haue giuen for an inheritance vnto your fathers.<note> Or, to. , Or, caused your fathers to possesse.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">But I said; How
shall I put thee among the children, and giue thee a pleasant land,
a goodly heritage of the hostes of nations? and I said, Thou shalt
call me; My father, and shalt not turne away from me.<note> Heb. land of desire. , Heb. land of desire. , Hebr. from after me.</note></ab>

<fw>True repentance.</fw>
<ab n="20">¶ Surely as
a wife treacherously departeth from her husband: so haue you dealt
treacherously with mee, O house of Israel, saith the
Lord.<note> Heb. friend</note></ab>
<ab n="21">A voice was
heard vpon the high places, weeping and supplications of the
children of Israel: for they haue peruerted their way, and they
haue forgotten the Lord their God.</ab>
<ab n="22">Returne ye
backsliding children, and I wil heale your backslidings: Beholde,
wee come vnto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.<note> Ose. 14.2.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">Truely in vaine
is saluation hoped for from the hilles, and from the multitude of
mountaines: truely in the Lord our God is the saluation of
Israel.</ab>
<ab n="24">For shame hath
deuoured the labour of our fathers from our youth: their flockes
and their heards, their sonnes and their daughters.</ab>
<ab n="25">We lie downe in
our shame, and our confusion couereth vs: for we haue sinned
against the Lord our God, wee and our fathers from our youth euen
vnto this day, and haue not obeied the voice of the Lord our
God.</ab>
