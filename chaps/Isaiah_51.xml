<ab n="1">Hearken to me, ye
that follow after righteousnesse, ye that seeke the Lord: looke
vnto the rocke whence yee are hewen, and to the hole of the pitte
whence ye are digged.</ab>
<ab n="2">Looke vnto Abraham
your father, and vnto Sarah that bare you: for I called him alone,
and blessed him, and increased him.</ab>
<ab n="3">For the Lord shall
comfort Zion: he wil comfort all her waste places, and he wil make
her wildernes like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the
Lord: ioy and gladnesse shalbe found therein, thankesgiuing, and
the voice of melody.</ab>
<ab n="4">¶ Hearken
vnto me, my people, and giue eare vnto me, O my nation: for a Law
shall proceed from mee, and I will make my iudgement to rest for a
light of the people.</ab>
<ab n="5">My righteousnes is
neere: my saluation is gone foorth, and mine armes shall iudge the
people: the Iles shall wait vpon me, and on mine arme shall they
trust.</ab>
<ab n="6">Lift vp your eyes
to the heauens, and looke vpon the earth beneath: for the heauens
shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall waxe old like a
garment, and they that dwel therein shall die in like maner: but my
saluation shal be for euer, and my righteousnes shall not be
abolished.<note> Psal. 102. 27. matth. 24.35.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">¶ Hearken
vnto me ye that know righteousnesse, the people in whose heart is
my Law: Feare ye not the reproch of men, neither be yee afraid of
their reuilings.<note> Psal.37. 31. , Matth.10. 27.</note></ab>

<fw>Gods righteousnesse.</fw>
<ab n="8">For the moth shall
eate them vp like a garment, and the worme shal eate them like
wooll: but my righteousnes shalbe for euer; and my saluation from
generation to generation.</ab>
<ab n="9">¶ Awake,
awake, put on strength, O arme of the Lord, awake as in the ancient
dayes, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut
Rahab, and wounded the dragon?<note> Psal. 74. 13,14. eze. 29.3.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">Art thou not it
which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deepe, that hath
made the depthes of the sea a way for the ransomed to passe
ouer?<note> Exod.14.21.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">Therefore the
redeemed of the Lord shall returne, and come with singing vnto
Zion, and euerlasting ioy shalbe vpon their head: they shall
obtaine gladnesse and ioy, and sorrow and mourning shall flee
away.<note> Chap. 35. 10. , Chap. 35. 10.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">I, euen I am hee
that comforteth you, who art thou that thou shouldest be afraid of
a man that shall die, and of the sonne of man which shall bee made
as grasse?<note> Psal.118. 6. , Chap.40. 6. 1.pet. 1. 24.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">And forgettest
the Lord thy maker that hath stretched foorth the heauens, and
layed the foundations of the earth? and hast feared continually
euery day, because of the furie of the oppressour, as if hee were
ready to destroy? and where is the furie of the
oppressour?<note> Or, made himselfe. ready.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">The captiue exile
hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that hee should not die in the
pit, nor that his bread should faile.</ab>
<ab n="15">But I am the Lord
thy God, that diuided the sea, whose waues roared: the Lord of
hosts is his Name.<note> Iere.31. 35.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">And I haue put my
wordes in thy mouth, and haue couered thee in the shadow of mine
hand, that I may plant the heauens, and lay the foundations of the
earth, and say vnto Zion, Thou art my people.<note> Chap. 49. 2,3.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">¶ Awake,
awake, stand vp, O Ierusalem, which hast drunke at the hand of the
Lord the cup of his furie; thou hast drunken the dregges of the cup
of trembling, and wrung them out.<note> Chap.52. 1.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">There is none to
guide her among all the sonnes whom shee hath brought foorth:
neither is there any that taketh her by the hand, of all the sonnes
that she hath brought vp.</ab>

<fw>The deliuerance of the Church.</fw>
<ab n="19">These two things
are come vnto thee; who shall be sorie for thee? desolation and
destruction, and the famine and the sword: by whom shall I comfort
thee?<note> Cha.47.9. , Hebr. happened. , Heb. breaking.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">Thy sonnes haue
fainted, they lie at the head of all the streetes as a wilde bull
in a net; they are full of the furie of the Lord, the rebuke of thy
God.</ab>
<ab n="21">¶ Therefore
heare now this thou afflicted and drunken, but not with
wine.</ab>
<ab n="22">Thus saith thy
Lord, the Lord and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people,
Behold, I haue taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, euen
the dregges of the cup of my furie: thou shalt no more drinke it
againe.</ab>
<ab n="23">But I will put it
into the hand of them that afflict thee: which haue said to thy
soule, Bow downe that wee may goe ouer: and thou hast laide thy
body as the ground, and as the streete to them that went
ouer.</ab>
