<head>CHAP. V.</head>
<head>1 The Philistines hauing brought the
Arke into Ashdod, set it in the house of Dagon. 3 Dagon is smitten
downe and cut in pieces, and they of Ashdod smitten with Emerods. 8
So God dealeth with them of Gath, when it was brought thither: 10
and so with them of Ekron when it was brought thither.</head>

<ab n="1">And the
Philistines tooke the Arke of God, and brought it from Ebenezer
vnto Ashdod.</ab>
<ab n="2">When the
Philistines tooke the Arke of God, they brought it into the house
of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.</ab>
<ab n="3">¶ And when
they of Ashdod arose earely on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen
vpon his face to the earth, before the Arke of the Lord: and they
tooke Dagon, and set him in his place againe.</ab>
<ab n="4">And when they
arose earely on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen vpon
his face to the ground, before the Arke of the Lord: and the head
of Dagon, and both the palmes of his hands were cut off vpon the
threshold, only the stumpe of Dagon was left to him.<note> Or, the filthy part.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">Therefore neither
the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagons house, tread on
the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod vnto this day.</ab>

<fw>The Philistins plagued.</fw>
<ab n="6">But the hand of
the Lord was heauy vpon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and
smote them with Emerods, euen Ashdod, and the coastes
thereof.<note> Psal. 78. 66.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">And when the men
of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The Arke of the God of
Israel shall not abide with vs: for his hand is sore vpon vs, and
vpon Dagon our god.</ab>
<ab n="8">They sent
therefore, and gathered all the lords of the Philistines vnto them,
and said, What shall we doe with the Arke of the God of Israel? And
they answered, Let the Arke of the God of Israel bee caried about
vnto Gath. And they caried the Arke of the God of Israel about
thither.</ab>
<ab n="9">And it was so,
that after they had caried it about, the hand of the Lord was
against the citie with a very great destruction: and hee smote the
men of the citie both small and great, and they had Emerods in
their secret parts.</ab>
<ab n="10">¶ Therfore
they sent the Arke of God to Ekron: and it came to passe as the
Arke of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying,
They haue brought about the Arke of the God of Israel to vs, to
slay vs, and our people.</ab>
<ab n="11">So they sent and
gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send
away the Arke of the God of Israel, and let it goe againe to his
owne place, that it slay vs not, and our people: for there was a
deadly destruction throughout all the citie: The hand of God was
very heauy there.</ab>
<ab n="12">And the men that
died not, were smitten with the Emerods: and the cry of the citie
went vp to heauen.</ab>
