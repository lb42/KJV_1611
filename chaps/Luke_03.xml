<fw>Christ obedient, Iohns preaching, and

<ab n="1">Now in the
fifteenth yeere of the reigne of Tiberius Cesar, Pontius Pilate
being Gouernour of Iudea, &amp; Herode being Tetrarch of Galilee,
and his brother Philip Tetrarch of Iturea, and of the region of
Trachonitis, and Lysanias the Tetrarch of Abilene,</ab>
<ab n="2">Annas and
Caiaphas being the high Priests, the word of God came vnto Iohn the
sonne of Zacharias, in the wildernesse.</ab>
<ab n="3">And he came
into all the countrey about Iordane, preaching the baptisme of
repentance, for the remissi≈ç of sinnes,<note> Mat.3.1.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">As it is
written in the book of the words of Esaias the Prophet, saying, The
voyce of one crying in the wildernesse, Prepare ye the way of the
Lord, make his paths straight.<note> Esai.40.3</note></ab>
<ab n="5">Euery valley
shall be filled, and euery mountaine and hill shalbe brought low,
and the crooked shall bee made straight, and the rough wayes shall
be made smooth.</ab>
<ab n="6">And all flesh
shal see the saluation of God.</ab>
<ab n="7">Then said hee
to the multitude that came forth to bee baptized of him, O
generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to
come?<note> Mat.3.7.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Bring forth
therfore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within
your selues, We haue Abraham to our father: For I say vnto you,
that God is able of these stones to raise vp children vnto
Abraham.<note> Or, meet for.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And now also
the axe is laid vnto the root of the trees: Euery tree therefore
which bringeth not foorth good fruit, is hewen downe, and cast into
the fire.</ab>
<ab n="10">And the people
asked him, saying, What shall we doe then?</ab>
<ab n="11">He answereth,
and saith vnto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him
that hath none, and he that hath meat, let him doe
likewise.<note> Iam. 2. 15. 1.ioh.3.17.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">Then came also
Publicanes to be baptized, and said vnto him, Master, what shall we
doe?</ab>
<ab n="13">And he said
vnto them, Exact no more then that which is appointed you.</ab>

<fw>Iohns preaching, and baptisme. Christ his
genealogie</fw>
<ab n="14">And the
souldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we doe?
And he said vnto them, Doe violence to no man, neither accuse any
falsely, &amp; be content with your wages.<note> Or, put no man in feare. , Or, allowance.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">And as the
people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of
Iohn, whether he were the Christ or not:<note> Or, in suspence. , Or, reasoned or debated.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">Iohn answered,
saying vnto them all, I indeede baptize you with water, but one
mightier then I commeth, the latchet of whose shooes I am not
worthy to vnloose, he shall baptize you with the holy Ghost, and
with fire.<note> Mat.3. 11</note></ab>
<ab n="17">Whose fanne is
in his hand, and he will thorowly purge his floore, and will gather
the wheat into his garner, but the chaffe he will burne with fire
vnquencheable.</ab>
<ab n="18">And many other
things in his exhortation preached he vnto the people.</ab>
<ab n="19">But Herode the
Tetrarch being reprooued by him for Herodias his brother Philips
wife, and for all the euils which Herode had done,<note> Mat. 14. 3.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">Added yet this
aboue all, that he shut vp Iohn in prison.</ab>
<ab n="21">Now when all
the people were baptized, and it came to passe that Iesus also
being baptized, and praying, the heauen was opened:<note> Mat. 3. 13.</note></ab>

came from heauen, which said, Thou art my beloued sonne, in thee I
am well pleased.</ab>
