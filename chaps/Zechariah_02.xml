<head>1 God in the care of Ierusalem
sendeth to measure it. 6 The redemption of Zion. 10 The promise of
Gods presence.</head>

<ab n="1">I lift vp mine
eyes againe, and looked, and behold, a man with a measuring line in
his hand.</ab>
<ab n="2">Then said I,
Whither goest thou? And hee said vnto me, To measure Ierusalem, to
see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length
thereof.</ab>
<ab n="3">And behold, the
Angel that talked with me, went foorth, and another Angel went out
to meete him:</ab>
<ab n="4">And said vnto
him, Run, speake to this young man, saying; Ierusalem shall be
inhabited as townes without walles, for the multitude of men and
cattell therein.</ab>
<ab n="5">For I, saith the
Lord, will be vnto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the
glory in the midst of her.</ab>
<ab n="6">¶ Ho, ho,
come foorth, and flee from the land of the North, saith the Lord:
for I haue spread you abroad as the foure windes of the heauen,
sayth the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="7">Deliuer thy
selfe, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.</ab>
<ab n="8">For thus sayth
the Lord of hostes, After the glory hath he sent me vnto the
nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you, toucheth the
apple of his eye.<note> Deu.32. 10. psal. 17.8.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">For behold, I
will shake mine hand vpon them, and they shall bee a spoile to
their seruants: and yee shall know that the Lord of hostes hath
sent me.</ab>
<ab n="10">¶ Sing and
reioyce, O daughter of Zion: for loe, I come, and I will dwell in
the middest of thee, sayth the Lord.<note> Isai 12.6. and 54.1. , Leuit. 26. 12. ezek. 37.27. 2. cor.6.18.</note></ab>

<fw>Satan rebuked.</fw>
<ab n="11">And many
nations shalbe ioyned to the Lord in that day, and shall be my
people: and I will dwel in the middest of thee, and thou shalt know
that the Lord of hostes hath sent me vnto thee.</ab>
<ab n="12">And the Lord
shall inherite Iudah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose
Ierusalem againe.</ab>
<ab n="13">Be silent, O
all flesh, before the Lord: for he is raised vp out of his holy
habitation.<note> Heb. the habitation of his holines.</note></ab>
