<ab n="1">And Abraham was

<ab n="2">And Abraham said
vnto his eldest seruant of his house, that ruled ouer all that he
had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand vnder my thigh:<note> Chap. 47. 29.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And I will make
thee sweare by the LORD the God of heauen, and the God of the
earth, that thou shalt not take a wife vnto my sonne of the
daughters of the Canaanites amongst whom I dwell.</ab>
<ab n="4">But thou shalt go
vnto my countrey, and to my kinred, and take a wife vnto my sonne
Isaac.</ab>
<ab n="5">And the seruant
said vnto him, Peraduenture the woman will not bee willing to
follow mee vnto this land: must I needes bring thy sonne againe,
vnto the land from whence thou camest?</ab>
<ab n="6">And Abraham said
vnto him, Beware thou, that thou bring not my sonne thither
againe.</ab>
<ab n="7">¶ The LORD
God of heauen which tooke mee from my fathers house, and from the
land of my kindred, and which spake vnto mee, and that sware vnto
me, saying, Unto thy seed will I giue this land, he shall send his
Angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife vnto my sonne from
thence.<note> Chap. 12. 7. and 13. 15. and 15. 18. and 26. 4.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">And if the woman
wil not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt bee cleare from
this my othe: onely bring not my sonne thither againe.</ab>
<ab n="9">And the seruant
put his hand vnder the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to
him concerning that matter.</ab>

<fw>Care to prouide a wife for
Isaac.</fw>
<ab n="10">¶ And the
seruant tooke ten camels, of the camels of his master, and
departed, ( for all the goods of his master were in his hand) and
he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, vnto the citie of
Nahor.<note> Or, And</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And he made his
camels to kneele downe without the citie, by a well of water, at
the time of the euening, euen the time that women goe out to draw
water.<note> Hebr. that wom which draw water, goe foorth.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">And he said, O
LORD, God of my master Abraham, I pray thee send me good speed this
day, and shew kindnesse vnto my master Abraham.</ab>
<ab n="13">Behold, I stand
here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the
Citie come out to draw water:<note> Vers.43.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And let it come
to passe, that the damsell to whom I shall say, Let downe thy
pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drinke, and she shall say, Drinke,
and I will giue thy camels drinke also; let the same be shee that
thou hast appointed for thy seruant Isaac: and thereby shall I know
that thou hast shewed kindnesse vnto my master.</ab>
<ab n="15">¶ And it
came to passe before hee had done speaking, that behold, Rebekah
came out, who was borne to Bethuel, sonne of Milcah, the wife of
Nahor Abrahams brother, with her pitcher vpon her shoulder.</ab>
<ab n="16">And the damsell
was very faire to looke vpon, a virgine, neither had any man knowen
her; and shee went downe to the wel, and filled her pitcher, and
came vp.<note> Hebr. good of countenance.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">And the seruant
ranne to meete her, and said, Let mee (I pray thee) drinke a little
water of thy pitcher.</ab>
<ab n="18">And she said,
Drinke, my lord: and she hasted, and let downe her pitcher vpon her
hand, and gaue him drinke.</ab>
<ab n="19">And when shee
had done giuing him drinke, she said, I will draw water for thy
camels also, vntill they haue done drinking.</ab>
<ab n="20">And she hasted
and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ranne againe vnto the
well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.</ab>
<ab n="21">And the man
wondering at her, helde his peace, to wit, whether the LORD had
made his iourney prosperous, or not.</ab>
<ab n="22">And it came to
passe as the camels had done drinking, that the man tooke a golden
eare-ring, of halfe a shekel weight, &amp; two bracelets for her
handes, of ten shekels weight of gold,<note> Or, iewell for the forehead.</note></ab>

<fw>Abrahams seruant, and Rebekah.</fw>
<ab n="23">And said, whose
daughter art thou? tell mee, I pray thee: is there roome in thy
fathers house for vs to lodge in?</ab>
<ab n="24">And she said
vnto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the sonne of Milcah, which
she bare vnto Nahor:</ab>
<ab n="25">She said
moreouer vnto him, We haue both straw &amp; prouender ynough, and
roome to lodge in.</ab>
<ab n="26">And the man
bowed downe his head, and worshipped the LORD.</ab>
<ab n="27">And hee saide,
Blessed bee the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left
destitute my master of his mercy, and his trueth: I being in the
way, the LORD led me to the house of my masters brethren.</ab>
<ab n="28">And the damsell
ranne, and told them of her mothers house, these things.</ab>
<ab n="29">¶ And
Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ranne out
vnto the man, vnto the well.</ab>
<ab n="30">And it came to
passe when he saw the eare-ring, and bracelets vpon his sisters
hands, and when hee heard the wordes of Rebekah his sister, saying,
Thus spake the man vnto me, that he came vnto the man; and behold,
hee stood by the camels, at the well.</ab>
<ab n="31">And he said,
Come in, thou blessed of the LORD, wherefore standest thou without?
for I haue prepared the house, and roome for the camels.</ab>
<ab n="32">¶ And the
man came into the house: and he vngirded his camels, and gaue straw
and prouender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the
mens feet that were with him.</ab>
<ab n="33">And there was
set meat before him to eate: but he said, I will not eate, vntill I
haue tolde mine errand. And hee said, Speake on.</ab>
<ab n="34">And he said, I
am Abrahams seruant.</ab>
<ab n="35">And the LORD
hath blessed my master greatly, and hee is become great: and hee
hath giuen him flocks, and heards, and siluer, and gold, and men
seruants, and mayd seruants, and camels, and asses.</ab>
<ab n="36">And Sarah my
masters wife bare a sonne to my master when shee was old: and vnto
him hath hee giuen all that he hath.</ab>
<ab n="37">And my master
made me sweare, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my sonne, of
the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:</ab>

<fw>Abrahams seruant, and Rebekah.</fw>
<ab n="38">But thou shalt
goe vnto my fathers house, and to my kinred, and take a wife vnto
my sonne.</ab>
<ab n="39">And I said vnto
my master, Peraduenture the woman will not followe me.</ab>
<ab n="40">And hee saide
vnto me, The LORD, before whom I walke, will send his Angel with
thee, and prosper thy way: and thou shalt take a wife for my sonne,
of my kinred, and of my fathers house.</ab>
<ab n="41">Then shalt thou
bee cleare from this my oath, when thou commest to my kinred, and
if they giue not thee one, thou shalt be cleare from my
oath.</ab>
<ab n="42">And I came this
day vnto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if
now thou doe prosper my way, which I goe:</ab>
<ab n="43">Behold, I stand
by the well of water; and it shall come to passe, that when the
virgine commeth foorth to draw water, and I say to her, Giue me, I
pray thee, a litle water of thy pitcher to drinke;<note> Verse 13.</note></ab>
<ab n="44">And she say to
me, Both drinke thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the
same be the woman, whō the LORD hath appointed out for my
masters sonne.</ab>
<ab n="45">And before I had
done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth, with her
pitcher on her shoulder; and she went downe vnto the well, and drew
water: and I said vnto her, Let me drinke, I pray thee.</ab>
<ab n="46">And she made
haste, &amp; let downe her pitcher from her shoulder, and saide,
Drinke, and I will giue thy camels drinke also: so I dranke, and
she made the camels drinke also.</ab>
<ab n="47">And I asked her,
and said, whose daughter art thou? and she said, The daughter of
Bethuel, Nahors sonne, whom Milcah bare vnto him: and I put the
earering vpon her face, and the bracelets vpon her hands.</ab>
<ab n="48">And I bowed
downe my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of
my master Abraham, which had led mee in the right way to take my
masters brothers daughter vnto his sonne.</ab>
<ab n="49">And now if you
wil deale kindly and truely with my master, tell me: and if not,
tell me, that I may turne to the right hand, or to the
left.</ab>

<fw>She becommeth wife to Isaac.</fw>
<ab n="50">Then Laban and
Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we
cannot speake vnto thee bad or good.</ab>
<ab n="51">Behold, Rebekah
is before thee, take her, and goe, and let her be thy masters
sonnes wife, as the LORD hath spoken.</ab>
<ab n="52">And it came to
passe, that when Abrahams seruant heard their words, he worshipped
the LORD, bowing himselfe to the earth.</ab>
<ab n="53">And the seruant
brought foorth iewels of siluer, and iewels of gold, and raiment,
and gaue them to Rebekah: He gaue also to her brother, and to her
mother precious things.<note> Hebr. vessels.</note></ab>
<ab n="54">And they did
eate and drinke, he and the men that were with him, and taried all
night, and they rose vp in the morning, and he said, Send me away
vnto my master.<note> Vers. 56. and 59.</note></ab>
<ab n="55">And her brother
and her mother said, Let the damsell abide with vs a few dayes, at
the least ten; after that, she shall goe.<note> Or, a full yeere, or, ten moneths.</note></ab>
<ab n="56">And he said vnto
them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way: send me
away, that I may goe to my master.</ab>
<ab n="57">And they said,
wee will call the Damsell, and enquire at her mouth.</ab>
<ab n="58">And they called
Rebekah, and said vnto her, Wilt thou go with this man? and she
said, I will goe.</ab>
<ab n="59">And they sent
away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abrahams seruant, and
his men.</ab>
<ab n="60">And they blessed
Rebekah, and said vnto her, Thou art our sister, bee thou the
mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possesse the gate
of those which hate them.</ab>
<ab n="61">¶ And
Rebekah arose, and her damsels, &amp; they rode vpon the camels,
and followed the man: and the seruant tooke Rebekah, and went his
way.</ab>
<ab n="62">And Isaac came
from the way of the well Lahai-roi, for he dwelt in the South
countrey.<note> Chap. 16. 14. and 25. 11.</note></ab>
<ab n="63">And Isaac went
out, to meditate in the field, at the euentide: and hee lift vp his
eyes, and saw, and behold, the camels were comming.<note> Or, to pray.</note></ab>
<ab n="64">And Rebekah lift
vp her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the
camel.</ab>

<fw>She becommeth wife to Isaac.</fw>
<ab n="65">For she had said
vnto the seruant, What man is this that walketh in the field to
meet vs? and the seruant had said, It is my master: therefore shee
tooke a vaile and couered her selfe.</ab>
<ab n="66">And the seruant
tolde Isaac all things that he had done.</ab>
<ab n="67">And Isaac
brought her into his mother Sarahs tent, and tooke Rebekah, and she
became his wife, and he loued her: and Isaac was comforted after
his mothers death.</ab>
