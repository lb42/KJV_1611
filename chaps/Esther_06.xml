<head>1 Ahasuerus reading in the
Chronicles of the good seruice done by Mordecai, taketh care for

vnawares giueth counsell that hee might doe him honour, 12
complayning of his misfortune, his friends tell him of his finall

<fw>Mordecai the Iew, promoted.</fw>
<ab n="1">On that night
could not the King sleepe, and hee commaunded to bring the booke of
Records of the chronicles; and they were read before the
king.<note> Hebr. the kings sleepe fled away.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And it was
found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana, and Teresh, two
of the kings chamberleus, the keepers of the doore, who sought to
lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.<note> Or, Bigthan, chap. 2.21. , Hebr. threshold.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And the king
said, What honour and dignitie hath bene done to Mordecai for this?
Then said the kings seruants that ministred vnto him, There is
nothing done for him.</ab>
<ab n="4">¶ And
the king said, Who is in the court? (now Haman was come into the
outward court of the kings house, to speake vnto the king, to hang
Mordecai on the gallons that hee had prepared for him.)</ab>
<ab n="5">And the kings
seruants said vnto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And
the King saide, Let him come in.</ab>
<ab n="6">So Haman came
in, and the king said vnto him, What shall be done vnto the man
whom the king delighteth to honour? (now Haman thought in his
heart, To whom would the king delight to doe honour, more then to
my selfe?)<note> Hebr. in whose honour the King delighteth.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">And Haman
answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to
honour,<note> Hebr. in whose honour the king delighteth.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Let the
royall apparell bee brought, which the King vseth to weare, and the
horse that the King rideth vpon, and the crowne royal which is set
vpon his head:<note> Hebr. let them bring the royall apparell. , Heb. wherwith the king clotheth himselfe.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And let this
apparell and horse bee deliuered to the hand of one of the kings
most noble Princes, that they may aray the man withall, whom the
king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horsebacke through the
streete of the city, and proclaime before him, Thus shal it be done
to the man whom the king delighteth to honour.<note> Heb. cause him to ride.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">Then the king
saide to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparell, and the horse,
as thou hast said, and doe euen so to Mordecai the Iew, that
sitteth at the Kings gate: let nothing faile of all that thou hast
spoken.<note> Heb. suffer not a whit to fall.</note></ab>

<fw>Mordecai the Iew, promoted.</fw>
<ab n="11">Then tooke Haman
the apparell, and the horse, &amp; arayed Mordecai, and brought him
on hors-backe through the streete of the city, and proclaimed
before him: Thus shall it bee done vnto the man whom the King
delighteth to honour.</ab>
<ab n="12">¶ And
Mordecai came againe to the kings gate: but Haman hasted to his
house, mourning, and hauing his head couered.</ab>
<ab n="13">And Haman told
Zeresh his wife, and all his friends, euery thing that had befallen
him. Then saide his wise men, and Zeresh his wife vnto him, If
Mordecai be of the seed of the Iewes, before whom thou hast begun
to fall, thou shalt not preuaile against him, but shalt surely fall
before him.</ab>
<ab n="14">And while they
were yet talking with him, came the kings chamberlens, and hasted
to bring Haman vnto the banquet that Esther had prepared.</ab>
