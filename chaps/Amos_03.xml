<head>1 The necessitie of Gods iudgement
against Israel. 9 The publication of it, with the causes
thereof.</head>

<ab n="1">Heare this word
that the Lord hath spoken against you, O children of Israel,
against the whole family, which I brought vp from the land of
Egypt, saying;</ab>
<ab n="2">You onely haue
I knowen of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish
you for all your iniquities.<note> Heb. visit vpon.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">Can two walke
together, except they be agreed?</ab>

<fw>Gods visitation.</fw>
<ab n="4">Will a lyon
roare in the forrest, when he hath no pray? will a young lyon cry
out of his den, if he haue taken nothing?<note> Heb. giue foorth his voyce.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">Can a bird fall
in a snare vpon the earth, where no ginne is for him? shall one
take vp a snare from the earth, and haue taken nothing at
all?</ab>
<ab n="6">Shall a trumpet
be blowen in the citie, and the people not be afraid? shall there
be euill in a citie, and the Lord hath not done it?<note> Or, not runne together. , Or, and shall not the L. doe somewhat?</note></ab>
<ab n="7">Surely the Lord
God will doe nothing, but he reuealeth his secret vnto his seruants
the Prophets.</ab>
<ab n="8">The lyon hath
roared, Who will not feare? the Lord God hath spoken, Who can but
prophecie?</ab>
<ab n="9">Â¶ Publish
in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt,
and say; Assemble your selues vpon the mountaines of Samaria: and
behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in
the midst thereof.<note> Or, oppressions.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">For they know
not to doe right, saith the Lord; who store vp violence, and
robberie in their palaces.<note> Or, spoile.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">Therefore thus
saith the Lord God, An aduersarie there shall be euen round about
the land: and he shal bring downe thy strength from thee, and thy
palaces shall be spoiled.</ab>
<ab n="12">Thus saith the
Lord, As the shepheard taketh out of the mouth of the lyon two
legges or a piece of an eare; so shall the children of Israel be
taken out that dwell in Samaria, in the corner of a bed, and in
Damascus in a couch.<note> Heb. deliuereth. , Or, on the beds feete.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Heare yee and
testifie in the house of Iacob, saith the Lord God, the God of
hostes;</ab>
<ab n="14">That in the
day that I shall visite the transgressions of Israel vpon him, I
will also visite the altars of Bethel, and the hornes of the altar
shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.<note> Or, punish Israel for.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">And I will
smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of
yuorie shall perish, and the great houses shall haue an end, saith
the Lord.</ab>
