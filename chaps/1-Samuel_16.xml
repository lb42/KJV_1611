<head>1 Samuel sent by God, vnder pretence
of a sacrifice, commeth to Bethlehem. 6 His humane iudgement is
reprooued. 11 He anointeth Dauid. 15 Saul sendeth for Dauid to
quiet his euill spirit.</head>


<fw>Samuel is sent, and annointeth
Dauid.</fw>
<ab n="1">And the Lord
said vnto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourne for Saul, seeing I haue
reiected him from reigning ouer Israel? Fill thine horne with oile,
and goe, I will send thee to Iesse the Bethlehemite: for I haue
prouided mee a King among his sonnes.</ab>
<ab n="2">And Samuel said,
How can I goe? if Saul heare it, he will kill mee. And the Lord
said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to
the Lord.<note> Hebr. in thine hand.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And call Iesse
to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt doe: and
thou shalt anoynt vnto mee him whom I name vnto thee.</ab>
<ab n="4">And Samuel did
that which the Lord spake, and came to Bethlehem: and the elders of
the towne trembled at his comming, and said, Commest thou
peaceably?<note> Hebr. meeting.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">And hee said,
Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice vnto the Lord: sanctifie your
selues, and come with me to the sacrifice: and he sanctified Iesse,
and his sonnes, and called them to the sacrifice.</ab>
<ab n="6">¶ And it
came to passe when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and
said, Surely the Lords anointed is before him.</ab>
<ab n="7">But the Lord
said vnto Samuel, Looke not on his countenance, or on the height of
his stature, because I haue refused him: for the Lord seeth not, as
man seeth; For man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord
looketh on the heart.<note> Hebr. eyes. , 1. Chron. 28 9. psal. 7.9. ierem. 11.20. and 17.10. and 20.12.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Then Iesse
called Abinadab, and made him passe before Samuel: and he said,
Neither hath the Lord chosen this.</ab>
<ab n="9">Then Iesse made
Shammah to passe by: and he said, Neither hath the Lord chosen
this.</ab>
<ab n="10">Againe Iesse
made seuen of his sonnes to passe before Samuel; and Samuel said
vnto Iesse, The Lord hath not chosen these.</ab>
<ab n="11">And Samuel
saide vnto Iesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There
remaineth yet the yongest, and behold, he keepeth the sheepe. And
Samuel said vnto Iesse, Send, and fetch him: for we will not sit
downe, till hee come hither.<note> 2. Sam. 7.8. psal. 78.71. , Heb. round.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">And he sent,
and brought him in: now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautifull
countenance, and goodly to looke to: And the Lord said, Arise,
anoint him: for this is he.<note> Hebr. faire of eyes.</note></ab>

<fw>Samuel is sent, and annointeth
Dauid.</fw>
<ab n="13">Then Samuel
tooke the horne of oile, and annointed him in the midst of his
brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came vpon Dauid, from that day
forward: So Samuel rose vp and went to Ramah.</ab>
<ab n="14">¶ But the
spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an euil spirit from the
Lord troubled him.<note> Or, terrified.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">And Sauls
seruants said vnto him, Behold now, an euill spirit from God
troubleth thee.</ab>
<ab n="16">Let our lord
now command thy seruants which are before thee, to seeke out a man,
who is a cunning player on an harpe: and it shall come to passe
when the euill spirit from God is vpon thee, that hee shall play
with his hand, and thou shalt be well.</ab>
<ab n="17">And Saul said
vnto his seruants, Prouide mee now a man, that can play well, and
bring him to me.</ab>
<ab n="18">Then answered
one of the seruants, and said, Behold, I haue seene a sonne of
Iesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty
valiant man, and a man of warre, and prudent in matters, and a
comely person, and the Lord is with him.<note> Or, speech.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">¶
Wherefore Saul sent messengers vnto Iesse, and said, Send me Dauid
thy sonne, which is with the sheepe.</ab>
<ab n="20">And Iesse tooke
an asse laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent
them by Dauid his sonne vnto Saul.</ab>
<ab n="21">And Dauid came
to Saul, and stood before him: and hee loued him greatly, and hee
became his armour bearer.</ab>
<ab n="22">And Saul sent
to Iesse, saying, Let Dauid, I pray thee, stand before me: for hee
hath found fauour in my sight.</ab>
<ab n="23">And it came to
passe, when the euill spirit from God was vpon Saul, that Dauid
tooke an harpe, and played with his hand: So Saul was refreshed,
and was well, and the euill spirit departed from him.</ab>
