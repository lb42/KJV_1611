<head>CHAP.
VIII.</head>
<head>1 At the opening of the seuenth
seale, 2 seuen Angels had seuen Trumpets giuen them. 6 Foure of
them sound their trumpets, and great plagues follow. 3 Another
Angel putteth incense to the prayers of the Saints on the golden
Altar.</head>

<ab n="1">And when hee
had opened the seuenth seale, there was silence in heauen about the
space of halfe an houre.</ab>
<ab n="2">And I sawe the
seuen Angels which stood before God, and to them were giuen seuen
trumpets.</ab>
<ab n="3">And another
Angel came &amp; stood at the altar, hauing a golden censer, and
there was giuen vnto him much incense, that hee should offer it
with the prayers of all Saints vpon the golden altar which was
before the throne.<note> Or, adde it to the prayers.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">And the smoke
of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints, ascended
vp before God, out of the Angels hand.</ab>
<ab n="5">And the Angel
tooke the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it
into the earth: and there were voyces, and thunderings, and
lightnings, and an earthquake:</ab>
<ab n="6">And the seuen
Angels which had the seuen trumpets, prepared themselues to
sound.</ab>
<ab n="7">The first Angel
sounded, and there followed haile, and fire mingled with blood, and
they were cast vpon the earth, and the third part of trees was
burnt vp, and all greene grasse was burnt vp.</ab>
<ab n="8">And the second
Angel sounded, and as it were a great mountaine burning with fire
was cast into the sea, and the third part of the sea became
blood.</ab>
<ab n="9">And the thirde
part of the creatures which were in the Sea, and had life, died,
and the third part of the ships were destroyed.</ab>
<ab n="10">And the third
Angel sounded, and there fell a great starre from heauen, burning
as it were a lampe, and it fell vpon the third part of the riuers,
and vpon the fountaines of waters:</ab>
<ab n="11">And the name
of the starre is called Wormewood, and the third part of the waters
became wormewood, and many men dyed of the waters, because they
were made bitter.</ab>

<fw>Seuen Angels sound trumpets.</fw>
<ab n="12">And the fourth
Angel sounded, and the thirde part of the Sunne was smitten, &amp;
the third part of the Moone, and the third part of the starres, so
as the third part of them was darkened: and the day shone not for a
third part of it, and the night likewise.</ab>
<ab n="13">And I beheld,
and heard an Angel flying through the midst of heauen, saying with
a loude voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth, by
reason of the other voyces of the trumpet of the three Angels which
are yet to sound.</ab>
