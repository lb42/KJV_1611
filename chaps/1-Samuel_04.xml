<head>CHAP. IV.</head>
<head>1 The Israelites are ouercome by the
Philistines at Aben-Ezer. 3 They fetch the Arke, vnto the terrour
of the Philistines. 10 They are smitten againe, the Arke taken,
Hophni and Phinehas are slaine. 12 Eli at the newes, falling
backward, breaketh his necke. 19 Phinehas wife, discouraged in her
trauaile with Ichabod, dieth.</head>

<ab n="1">And the word of
Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the
Philistines to battell, and pitched beside Eben-ezer: and the
Philistines pitched in Aphek.<note> Or, came to passe: Hebr. was.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And the
Philistines put themselues in aray against Israel: and when they
ioyned battell, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they
slew of the armie in the field, about foure thousand
men.<note> Hebr. the battell was spread. , Hebr. the aray.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">¶ And when
the people were come into the campe, the Elders of Israel said,
Wherefore hath the Lord smitten vs to day before the Philistines?
Let vs fetch the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord out of Shiloh
vnto vs, that when it commeth among vs, it may saue vs out of the
hand of our enemies.<note> Hebr. take vnto vs.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">So the people
sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the Arke of the
Couenant of the Lord of hostes, which dwelleth betweene the
Cherubims: and the two sonnes of Eli, Hophni, and Phinehas were
there, with the Arke of the Couenant of God.</ab>
<ab n="5">And when the Arke
of the Couenant of the Lord came into the campe, all Israel shouted
with a great shout, so that the earth rang againe.</ab>

<fw>Eli dieth.</fw>
<ab n="6">And when the
Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth
the noise of this great shout in the campe of the Hebrewes? And
they vnderstood, that the Arke of the Lord was come into the
campe.</ab>
<ab n="7">And the
Philistines were afraid, for they saide, God is come into the
campe. And they said, Woe vnto vs: for there hath not bene such a
thing heretofore.<note> Hebr. yesterday, or the third day.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Woe vnto vs: who
shall deliuer vs out of the hand of these mightie Gods? these are
the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the
wildernesse.</ab>
<ab n="9">Bee strong, and
quit your selues like men, O ye Philistines, that yee be not
seruants vnto the Hebrewes, as they haue bene to you: quit your
selues like men, and fight.<note> Iudg.13. 1. , Hebr. Be men.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">¶ And the
Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled euery man
into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter, for there fell
of Israel thirtie thousand footmen.</ab>
<ab n="11">And the Arke of
God was taken, and the two sonnes of Eli, Hophni, and Phinehas were
slaine.<note> Hebr. died.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">¶ And there
ran a man of Beniamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same
day with his clothes rent, and with earth vpon his head.</ab>
<ab n="13">And when hee
came, loe, Eli sate vpon a seat by the way side, watching: for his
heart trembled for the Arke of God. And when the man came into the
citie, and told it, all the city cried out.</ab>
<ab n="14">And when Eli
heard the noise of the crying, hee said; What meaneth the noise of
this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.</ab>
<ab n="15">Now Eli was
ninetie and eight yeeres old, and his eyes were dimme, that he
could not see.<note> Chap.3. 2. , Hebr. stood.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">And the man said
vnto Eli, I am he, that came out of the army, and I fled to day out
of the army. And he said, What is there done, my sonne?<note> Hebr. is the thing.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">And the
messenger answered, and said, Israel is fled before the
Philistines, and there hath bene also a great slaughter among the
people, and thy two sonnes also, Hophni &amp; Phinehas, are dead,
and the Arke of God is taken.</ab>
<ab n="18">And it came to
passe when hee made mention of the Arke of God, that he fell from
off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his necke brake,
and hee died: for hee was an old man, and heauie, and hee had
iudged Israel fortie yeeres.</ab>

<fw>Dagons fall. The Philistins
plagued.</fw>
<ab n="19">¶ And his
daughter in law Phinehas wife was with childe neere to be
deliuered: and when shee heard the tidings that the Arke of God was
taken, and that her father in law, and her husband were dead, shee
bowed her selfe and traueyled; for her paines came vpon
her.<note> Or, to crie out. , Hebr. were turned.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">And about the
time of her death, the women that stood by her, said vnto her:
Feare not, for thou hast borne a sonne. But she answered not,
neither did she regard it.<note> Heb. set not her heart</note></ab>
<ab n="21">And she named
the childe Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel,
(because the Arke of God was taken, and because of her father in
law and her husband.)<note> That is, where is the glory? , Or, there is no glory.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">And she said,
The glory is departed from Israel: for the Arke of God is
taken.</ab>
