<head>CHAP. XV.</head>
<head>1 The seuenth yeere a yeere of
release for the poore. 7 It must be no let of lending or giuing. 12
An Ebrew seruant, 16 except hee will not depart, must in the
seuenth yeere goe foorth free and well furnished. 19 All firstlings
males of the cattell are to bee sanctified vnto the
Lord.</head>

<ab n="1">At the end of
euery seuen yeeres thou shalt make a release.<note> Leuit.25. 2, 4.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And this is
the maner of the release: Euery creditour that lendeth ought vnto
his neighbour, shall release it: hee shall not exact it of his
neighbour, or of his brother, because it is called the Lords
release.<note> Heb. master of the lending of his hand.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">Of a
forreiner thou mayest exact it againe: but that which is thine with
thy brother, thine hand shall release.</ab>
<ab n="4">Saue when
there shall bee no poore among you: for the Lord shal greatly
blesse thee in the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee for an
inheritance to possesse it:<note> Or, to the end that there be no poore among you.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">Onely if thou
carefully hearken vnto the voice of the Lord thy God, to obserue to
doe all these commandedements, which I commaund thee this
day.</ab>
<ab n="6">For the Lord
thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee, and thou shalt lend
vnto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow, and thou shalt reigne
ouer many nations, but they shall not reigne ouer thee.<note> Chap.28. 12.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">¶ If
there be among you a poore man of one of thy brethren within any of
thy gates, in thy lande which the Lord thy God giueth thee, thou
shalt not harden thy heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poore
brother:</ab>
<ab n="8">But thou
shalt open thine hand wide vnto him, and shalt surely lend him
sufficient for his neede, in that which he wanteth.<note> Mat.5.42 luke 6.34.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">Beware that
there bee not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seuenth
yeere, the yeere of release is at hand, and thine eye be euill
against thy poore brother, and thou giuest him nought, and hee crie
vnto the Lord against thee, and it be sinne vnto thee.<note> Heb. word. , Heb. Belial</note></ab>

<fw>Of freedome.</fw>
<ab n="10">Thou shalt
surely giue him, and thine heart shall not bee grieued when thou
giuest vnto him: because that for this thing the Lord thy God shall
blesse thee in all thy workes, and in all that thou puttest thine
hand vnto.</ab>
<ab n="11">For the
poore shall neuer cease out of the land: therefore I command thee,
saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide vnto thy brother, to thy
poore, and to thy needy in the land.</ab>
<ab n="12">¶ And
if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold vnto
thee, and serue thee sixe yeres, then in the seuenth yeere thou
shalt let him goe free from thee.<note> Exod.21. 2. iere. 34. 14.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">And when
thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away
emptie:</ab>
<ab n="14">Thou shalt
furnish him liberally out of thy flocke, and out of thy floore, and
out of thy wine presse, of that wherewith the Lord thy God hath
blessed thee thou shalt giue vnto him.</ab>
<ab n="15">And thou
shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and
the Lord thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing
to day.</ab>
<ab n="16">And it shall
be if he say vnto thee, I will not goe away from thee, because he
loueth thee, and thine house, because he is well with thee:</ab>
<ab n="17">Then thou
shalt take an aule, and thrust it through his eare vnto the doore,
and hee shall be thy seruant for euer: and also vnto thy mayd
seruant thou shalt doe likewise.<note> Exod.21. 6.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">It shall not
seeme hard vnto thee when thou sendest him away free from thee: for
hee hath bene worth a double hired seruant to thee, in seruing thee
sixe yeeres: and the Lord thy God shall blesse thee in all that
thou doest.</ab>
<ab n="19">¶ All
the firstling males that come of thy heard, and of thy flock, thou
shalt sanctifie vnto the Lord thy God: thou shalt doe no worke with
the firstling of thy bullocke, nor sheare the firstling of thy
sheepe.<note> Exod. 34. 19.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">Thou shalt
eate it before the Lord thy God yeere by yeere, in the place which
the Lord shall choose, thou and thy houshold.</ab>
<ab n="21">And if there
be any blemish therein; as if it be lame, or blinde, or haue any
ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it vnto the Lord thy
God.<note> Leuit. 22. 20. cha.17. 1. ecclus. 35.12.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">Thou shalt
eate it within thy gates: the vncleane and the cleane person shall
eat it alike, as the Roe bucke, and as the Hart.</ab>

<fw>Solemne feasts.</fw>
<ab n="23">Onely thou
shalt not eate the blood thereof: thou shalt powre it vpon the
ground as water.<note> Chap. 12. 16,23.</note></ab>
