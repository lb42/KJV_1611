<head>CHAP.
XXXII.</head>
<head>1 A lamentation for the fearefull
fall of Egypt. 11 The sword of Babylon shall destroy it. 17 It
shall be brought downe to hell, among all the vncircumcised
Nations.</head>

<ab n="1">And it came to
passe in the twelfth yeere, in the twelft moneth, in the first day
of the moneth, that the word of the Lord came vnto me,
saying;</ab>
<ab n="2">Sonne of man,
take vp a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say vnto him;
Thou art like a young lyon of the nations, &amp; thou art as a
whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy riuers, and
troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their
riuers.<note> Or, dragon.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">Thus saith the
Lord God; I will therefore spread out my net ouer thee, with a
company of many people, and they shall bring thee vp in my
net.<note> Chap. 12. 13. and 17. 20.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">Then will I leaue
thee vpon the land, I will cast thee forth vpon the open field, and
will cause all the foules of the heauen to remaine vpon thee, and I
will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.</ab>
<ab n="5">And I will lay
thy flesh vpon the mountaines, and fill the valleis with thy
height.</ab>
<ab n="6">I will also water
with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, euen to the
mountaines, and the riuers shall be full of thee.<note> Or, the land of thy swimming.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">And when I shall
put thee out, I wil couer the heauen, and make the starres thereof
darke: I will couer the sunne with a cloud, and the moone shall not
giue her light.<note> Or, extinguish. , Isai. 13. 10. ioel.2. 31. and 3. 15. matth. 24.29.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">All the bright
lights of heauen will I make darke ouer thee, and set darkenesse
vpon thy land, saith the Lord God.<note> Heb. lights of the light in heauen. , Heb. them darke.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">I wil also vex
the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among
the nations, into the countries which thou hast not
knowen.<note> Heb. prouoke to anger, or griefe.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">Yea I will make
many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly
afraide for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them, and
they shall tremble at euery moment; euerie man for his owne life,
in the day of thy fall.</ab>
<ab n="11">¶ For thus
saith the Lord God, The sword of the king of Babylon shal come vpon
thee.</ab>

<fw>The desolation of Egypt.</fw>
<ab n="12">By the swords of
the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the
nations all of them: and they shall spoile the pompe of Egypt, and
all the multitude therof shall be destroyed.</ab>
<ab n="13">I will destroy
also all the beasts thereof from besides the great waters, neither
shall the foote of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofes of
beasts trouble them.</ab>
<ab n="14">Then will I make
their waters deepe, and cause their riuers to runne like oyle,
saith the Lord God.</ab>
<ab n="15">When I shall
make the land of Egypt desolate, and the countrey shall be
destitute of that wherof it was full; when I shall smite all them
that dwell therein, then shal they know that I am the
Lord.<note> Heb. desolate from the fulnesse therof.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">This is the
lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the daughters of the
nations shall lament her: they shall lament for her, euen for Egypt
and for al her multitude, saith the Lord God.</ab>
<ab n="17">¶ It came
to passe also in the twelfth yeere, in the fifteenth day of the
moneth, that the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying;</ab>
<ab n="18">Sonne of man,
waile for the multitude of Egypt, &amp; cast them downe, euen her,
and the daughters of the famous nations, vnto the nether parts of
the earth, with them that goe downe into the pit.</ab>
<ab n="19">Whom doest thou
passe in beautie? goe downe, and be thou layed with the
vncircumcised.</ab>
<ab n="20">They shall fall
in the middest of them that are slaine by the sword: she is
deliuered to the sword; draw her and all her
multitudes.<note> Or, the sword is layd.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">The strong among
the mighty shall speake to him out of the middest of hell with them
that helpe him: they are gone downe, they lie vncircumcised, slaine
by the sword.</ab>
<ab n="22">Ashur is there,
and all her companie: his graues are about him: al of them slaine,
fallen by the sword.</ab>
<ab n="23">Whose graues are
set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about her
graue: all of them slaine, fallen by the sword, which caused
terrour in the land of the liuing.<note> Or, dismaying.</note></ab>

<fw>The end of tyrants.</fw>
<ab n="24">There is Elam
and all her multitude round about her graue, all of them slaine,
fallen by the sword, which are gone downe vncircumcised into the
nether parts of the earth, which caused their terrour in the lande
of the liuing, yet haue they borne their shame with them that goe
downe to the pit.</ab>
<ab n="25">They haue set
her a bed in the midst of the slaine with all her multitudes: her
graues are round about him, all of them vncircumcised, slaine by
the sword: though their terrour was caused in the land of the
liuing, yet haue they borne their shame with them that goe downe to
the pit: he is put in the midst of them that be slaine.</ab>
<ab n="26">There is
Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graues are round about
him: all of them vncircumcised, slaine by the sword, though they
caused their terrour in the land of the liuing.</ab>
<ab n="27">And they shall
not lie with the mightie, that are fallen of the vncircumcised,
which are gone downe to hell with their weapons of warre: and they
haue laid their swords vnder their heads, but their iniquities
shalbe vpon their bones, though they were the terrour of the
mightie in the land of the liuing.<note> Hebr. with weapons of their warre.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">Yea thou shalt
be broken in the midst of the vncircumcised, and shalt lie with
them that are slaine with þ<note/> sword.</ab>
<ab n="29">There is Edom,
her kings and all her princes, which with their might are laid by
them that were slaine by the sword: they shall lie with the
vncircumcised, and with them that go downe to the pit.<note> Heb. giuen or put.</note></ab>
<ab n="30">There be the
princes of the North all of them, and all the Zidomans: which are
gone downe with the slaine, with their terrour they are ashamed of
their might, and they lie vncircumcised with them that be slaine by
the sword, and beare their shame with them that goe downe to the
pit.</ab>
<ab n="31">Pharaoh shall
see them, and shall bee comforted ouer all his multitude, euen
Pharaoh and all his armie slaine by the sword, saith the Lord
God.</ab>
<ab n="32">For I haue
caused my terrour in the land of the liuing: and he shall bee laid
in the midst of the vncircumcised with them that are slaine with
the sword, euen Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord
God.</ab>
