<head>CHAP.
XXIII.</head>
<head>1 As Paul pleadeth his cause, 2
Ananias commandeth them to smite him. 7 Dissension among his
accusers. 11 God encourageth him. 14 The Iewes laying waite for
Paul, 20 is declared vnto the chiefe captaine. 27 He sendeth him to
Felix the gouernour.</head>

<ab n="1">And Paul
earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I haue
liued in all good conscience before God vntill this day.</ab>
<ab n="2">And the high
Priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him, to smite him on
the mouth.</ab>
<ab n="3">Then saith
Paul vnto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest
thou to iudge mee after the Law, and commandest mee to be smitten
contrary to the Law?</ab>
<ab n="4">And they that
stood by, said, Reuilest thou Gods high Priest?</ab>
<ab n="5">Then said
Paul, I wist not, brethren, that hee was the high Prist: For it is
written, Thou shalt not speake euill of the ruler of thy
people.<note> Exod.22. 27.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">But when Paul
perceiued that the one part were Sadducees, and the other
Pharisees, hee cryed out in the Councill, Men and brethren, I am a
Pharisee, the sonne of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of
the dead, I am called in question.<note> Phil.3.5. , Chap. 24. 21.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">And when hee
had so said, there arose a dissension betweene the Pharisees and
the Sadducees: and the multitude was diuided.</ab>
<ab n="8">For the
Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither Angel, nor
spirit: but the Pharisees confesse both.<note> Matt. 22. 23.</note></ab>

<fw>A rash vow.</fw>
<ab n="9">And there
arose a great cry: and the Scribes that were of the Pharisees part
arose, and stroue, saying, Wee finde no euill in this man: but if a
spirit or an Angel hath spoken to him, let vs not fight against
God.</ab>
<ab n="10">And when there
arose a great dissension, the chiefe captaine fearing lest Paul
should haue bene pulled in pieces of them, commanded the souldiers
to goe downe, and to take him by force from among them, and to
bring him into the castle.</ab>
<ab n="11">And the night
folowing, the Lord stood by him, and saide, Bee of good cheere,
Paul: for as thou hast testified of mee in Hierusalem, so must thou
beare witnesse also at Rome.</ab>
<ab n="12">And when it was
day, certaine of the Iewes banded together, and bound themselues
vnder a curse, saying, that they would neither eate nor drinke till
they had killed Paul.<note> Or, with an oath of execration.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">And they were more
then fourtie which had made this conspiracie.</ab>
<ab n="14">And they came to
the chiefe Priests and Elders, and said, Wee haue bound our selues
vnder a great curse, that wee will eate nothing vntill wee haue
slaine Paul.</ab>
<ab n="15">Now therefore ye
with the Councill, signifie to the chiefe captaine that he bring
him downe vnto you to morrow, as though yee would enquire something
more perfectly concerning him: and we, or euer he come neere, are
ready to kill him.</ab>
<ab n="16">And when Pauls
sisters sonne heard of their laying in wait, hee went and entred
into the castle, &amp; told Paul.</ab>
<ab n="17">Then Paul called
one of the Centurions vnto him, and said, Bring this yong man vnto
the chiefe captaine: for he hath a certaine thing to tell
him.</ab>
<ab n="18">So he took him, and
brought him to the chiefe captaine, and said, Paul the prisoner
called me vnto him, and praied mee to bring this yong man vnto
thee, who hath something to say vnto thee.</ab>
<ab n="19">Then the chiefe
captaine tooke him by the hand, and went with him aside priuately,
and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?</ab>
<ab n="20">And he said, The
Iewes haue agreed to desire thee, that thou wouldest bring downe
Paul to morrow into the Council, as though they would enquire
somewhat of him more perfectly.</ab>

<fw>Paul sent to Felix.</fw>
<ab n="21">But do not thou
yeeld vnto them: for there lie in wait for him of them moe then
fourtie men, which haue bound themselues with an othe, that they
will neither eate nor drinke, till they haue killed him: and now
are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.</ab>
<ab n="22">So the chiefe
captaine then let the yong man depart, and charged him, See thou
tell no man, that thou hast shewed these things to me.</ab>
<ab n="23">And he called vnto
him two Centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred souldiers to goe
to Cesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearemen two
hundred, at the third houre of the night.</ab>
<ab n="24">And prouide them
beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe vnto Felix
the gouernour.</ab>
<ab n="25">And hee wrote a
letter after this manner:</ab>
<ab n="26">Claudius Lysias,
vnto the most excellent Gouernour Felix, sendeth greeting.</ab>
<ab n="27">This man was taken
of the Iewes and should haue beene killed of them: Then came I with
an armie, and rescued him, hauing vnderstood that he was a
Romane.</ab>
<ab n="28">And when I would
haue knowen the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him
foorth into their Council.</ab>
<ab n="29">Whom I perceiued to
be accused of questions of their lawe, but to haue nothing laide to
his charge worthy of death or of bonds.</ab>
<ab n="30">And when it was
tolde me, how that the Iewes laid waite for the man, I sent
straightway to thee, and gaue commandement to his accusers also, to
say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.</ab>
<ab n="31">Then the souldiers,
as it was commaunded them, tooke Paul, and brought him by night to
Antipatris.</ab>
<ab n="32">On the morow, they
left the horsemen to goe with him, and returned to the
castle.</ab>
<ab n="33">Who when they came
to Cesarea, and deliuered the Epistle to the gouernour, presented
Paul also before him.</ab>
<ab n="34">And when the
gouernour had read the letter, he asked of what prouince he was.
And when he vnderstood that he was of Cilicia:</ab>
<ab n="35">I will heare thee,
said hee, when thine accusers are also come. And hee commanded him
to be kept in Herods iudgement hall.</ab>
