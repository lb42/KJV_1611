<ab n="1">I am sought of
them that asked not for me: I am found of them that sought me not:
I said, Behold me, behold me, vnto a nation that was not called by
my name.<note> Rom.10. 20. , Rom.9. 24.25,26. eph. 2.12.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">I haue spread out
my hands all the day vnto a rebellious people, which walketh in a
way that was not good, after their owne thoughts:</ab>
<ab n="3">A people that
prouoketh mee to anger continually to my face, that sacrificeth in
gardens, and burneth incense vpon altars of bricke:<note> Heb. vpon brickes.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">Which remaine
among the graues, and lodge in the monuments, which eate swines
flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their
vessels:<note> Or, pieces.</note></ab>

<fw>Ioy of the Elect.</fw>
<ab n="5">Which say; Stand
by thy selfe, come not neere to me; for I am holier then thou:
these are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the
day.<note> Or, anger.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">Behold, it is
written before me: I will not keepe silence, but will recompence,
euen recompence into their bosome,</ab>
<ab n="7">Your iniquities,
and the iniquities of your fathers together, (saith the Lord) which
haue burnt incense vpon the mountaines, &amp; blasphemed mee vpon
the hils: therfore will I measure their former worke into their
bosome.</ab>
<ab n="8">¶ Thus saith
the Lord, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith,
Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it: so wil I doe for my
seruants sakes, that I may not destroy them all.</ab>
<ab n="9">And I will bring
forth a seede out of Iacob, and out of Iudah an inheritour of my
mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my seruants shall
dwell there.</ab>
<ab n="10">And Sharon shall
be a fold of flockes, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds
to lie downe in, for my people that haue sought me.</ab>
<ab n="11">¶ But yee
are they that for sake the Lord, that forget my holy mountaine,
that prepare a table for that troope, and that furnish the drinke
offring vnto that number.<note> Or, Gad. , Or, Meni.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">Therefore will I
number you to the sword, and yee shall all bow downe to the
slaughter: because when I called, yee did not answere; when I
spake, yee did not heare, but did euill before mine eyes, and did
choose that wherein I delighted not:<note> Prou.1. 23. ier.7. 13. , Chap. 66. 4.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Therefore thus
saith the Lord God; Behold, my seruants shall eate, but ye shall be
hungry: behold, my seruants shall drinke, but yee shall be
thirstie: behold, my seruants shall reioyce, but yee shall be
ashamed.</ab>
<ab n="14">Behold, my
seruants shall sing for ioy of heart, but yee shall cry for sorrow
of heart, and shall howle for vexation of spirit.<note> Heb. breaking.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">And yee shall
leaue your name for a curse vnto my chosen: for the Lord God shall
slay thee, and call his seruants by another name:</ab>
<ab n="16">That he who
blesseth himselfe in the earth, shall blesse himselfe in the God of
trueth; and he that sweareth in the earth, shall sweare by the God
of trueth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because
they are hid from mine eyes.</ab>

<fw>New Ierusalem.</fw>
<ab n="17">¶ For
behold, I create new heauens, and a new earth: &amp; the former
shal not be remembred, nor come into mind.<note> Chap. 66. 22. 2.pet. 3.13. reu. 21.1. , Heb. come vp on the heart.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">But bee you glad
and reioyce for euer in that which I create: for beholde, I create
Ierusalem a reioycing, and her people a ioy.</ab>
<ab n="19">And I wil reioyce
in Ierusalem, and ioy in my people, and the voice of weeping shall
be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.<note> Reu.21.4.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">There shalbe no
more thence an infant of dayes, nor an olde man, that hath not
filled his dayes: for the childe shall die an hundreth yeeres olde:
but the sinner being an hundreth yeres old, shalbe
accursed.</ab>
<ab n="21">And they shall
builde houses, and inhabite them, and they shall plant vineyards,
and eate the fruit of them.</ab>
<ab n="22">They shal not
build, and another inhabit: they shall not plant, and another eat:
for as the daies of a tree, are the dayes of my people, and mine
elect shal long enioy the worke of their hands.<note> Heb. shall make them continue long, or shall weare out.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">They shall not
labour in vaine, nor bring forth for trouble: for they are the
seede of the blessed of the Lord, and their offspring with
them.</ab>
<ab n="24">And it shal come
to passe, that before they call, I will answere, &amp; whiles they
are yet speaking, I will heare.<note> Psal. 32. 5.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">The wolfe and the
lambe shall feede together, and the lyon shall eate straw like the
bullocke: and dust shalbe the serpents meat. They shall not hurt
nor destroy in all my holy mountaine, sayth the Lord.<note> Isai.11. 6,7.</note></ab>
