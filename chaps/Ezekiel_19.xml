<head>1 A lamentation for the Princes of
Israel, vnder the parable of Lyons whelpes taken in a pit, 10 and
for Ierusalem, vnder the parable of a wasted vine.</head>


<fw>Two lyons.</fw>
<ab n="1">Moreouer, take
thou vp a lamentation for the princes of Israel,</ab>
<ab n="2">And say, What is
thy mother? a lyonesse: shee lay downe among lions, she nourished
her whelpes among yong lions.</ab>
<ab n="3">And shee brought
vp one of her whelps: it became a yong lion, &amp; it learned to
catch the pray, it deuoured men.</ab>
<ab n="4">The nations also
heard of him, hee was taken in their pit, and they brought him with
chaines vnto the land of Egypt.<note> 2.Kings 23.33. ier. 22.11.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">Now when she saw
that shee had waited, and her hope was lost, then she tooke another
of her whelps, and made him a yong lion.</ab>
<ab n="6">And he went vp
and downe among the lions, he became a yong lion, and learned to
catch the pray, and deuoured men.</ab>
<ab n="7">And he knew there
desolate palaces, and he laied waste their cities, and the land was
desolate, and the fulnesse thereof by the noise of his
roaring.<note> Or, their widowes.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Then the nations
set against him on euery side from the prouinces, and spread their
net ouer him: he was taken in their pit.</ab>
<ab n="9">And they put him
in ward in chaines, and brought him to the king of Babylon, they
brought him into holds, that his voyce should no more be heard vpon
the mountaines of Israel.<note> Or, in hookes.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">Â¶ Thy
mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters, she was
fruitfull and full of branches by reason of many
waters,<note> Or, in thy quietnesse or in thy likenesse.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And she had
strong rods for the scepters of them that beare rule, and her
stature was exalted among the thicke branches, &amp; she appeared
in her height with the multitude of her branches.</ab>
<ab n="12">But she was
plucked vp in fury: she was cast downe to the ground, and the East
wind dryed vp her fruite: her strong rods were broken and withered,
the fire consumed them.<note> Os.13. 15.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">And now she is
planted in the wildernesse, in a dry and thirsty ground.</ab>
<ab n="14">And fire is gone
out of a rod of her branches, which hath deuoured her fruite, so
that she hath no strong rod to be a scepter to rule: this is a
lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.</ab>
