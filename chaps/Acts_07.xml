<head>CHAP.
VII.</head>
<head>1 Steuen permitted to answere to the
accusation of blasphemie, 2 Sheweth that Abraham worshipped God
rightly, and how God chose the Fathers 20 before Moses was borne,
and before the Tabernacle and Temple were built: 37 that Moses
himselfe witnessed of Christ: 44 and that all outward Ceremonies
were ordeined according to the heauenly paterne, to last but for a
time: 51 reprehending their rebellion, and murthering of Christ,
the Iust One, whome the Prophets foretold should come into the
world. 54 Whereupon they stone him to death, who commendeth his
soule to Iesus, and humbly prayeth for them.</head>

<ab n="1">Then said the
high Priest, Are these things so?</ab>
<ab n="2">And hee said,
Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken: The God of glory appeared vnto
our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in
Charran,</ab>
<ab n="3">And said vnto
him, Get thee out of thy countrey, and from thy kinred, and come
into the land which I shall shew thee.<note> Gen.12, 1</note></ab>
<ab n="4">Then came he
out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from
thence, when his father was dead, he remoued him into this lande
wherein ye now dwell.</ab>
<ab n="5">And he gaue him
none inheritance in it, no not so much as to set his foote on: yet
he promised that he would giue it to him for a possession, and to
his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.</ab>
<ab n="6">And God spake
on this wise, that his seede should soiourne in a strange land, and
that they should bring them into bondage, and intreate them euill
foure hundreth yeeres.</ab>

<fw>Steuen repeateth the historie of Israel,
reproueth them, and is stoned</fw>
<ab n="7">And the nation
to whom they shal bee in bondage, will I iudge, saide God: And
after that shall they come forth, and serue me in this
place.</ab>
<ab n="8">And he gaue him
the couenant of Circumcision: and so Abraham begate Isaac, and
circumcised him the eight day: and Isaac begate Iacob, and Iacob
begate the twelue Patriarchs.<note> Gen.17.9 , Gen.21.3 , Gene.25. 26. , Gen.29. 31.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And the
Patriarchs moued with enuie, sold Ioseph into Egypt: but God was
with him,<note> Gen.37. 28.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">And deliuered
him out of all his afflictions, and gaue him fauour and wisedome in
the sight of Pharao king of Egypt: and he made him gouernour ouer
Egypt and all his house.<note> Gen.41. 37.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">Now there came
a dearth ouer all the land of Egypt, and Chanaan, and great
affliction, and our fathers found no sustenance.</ab>
<ab n="12">But when Iacob
heard that there was corne in Egypt, he sent out our fathers
first.<note> Gen.42.1</note></ab>
<ab n="13">And at the
second time Ioseph was made knowen to his brethren, and Iosephs
kinred was made knowen vnto Pharao.<note> Gen.45.4</note></ab>
<ab n="14">Then sent
Ioseph, and called his father Iacob to him, and all his kinred,
threescore and fifteeene soules.</ab>
<ab n="15">So Iacob went
downe into Egypt, and died, he and our fathers,<note> Gen.46.5 , Gen.49. 33.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">And were
caried ouer into Sichem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham
bought for a summe of money of the sonnes of Emor the father of
Sichem.</ab>
<ab n="17">But when the
time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworne to Abraham, the
people grew and multiplied in Egypt,</ab>
<ab n="18">Till another
king arose, which knew not Ioseph.</ab>
<ab n="19">The same dealt
subtilly with our kinred, and euill intreated our fathers, so that
they cast out their yong children, to the end they might not
liue.</ab>
<ab n="20">In which time
Moses was borne, and was exceeding faire, and nourished vp in his
fathers house three moneths:<note> Exo.2.2. , Heb.11. 23. , Or, faire to God.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">And when he
was cast out, Pharaohs daughter tooke him vp, and nourished him for
her owne sonne.</ab>
<ab n="22">And Moses was
learned in all the wisedome of the Egyptians, and was mightie in
words and in deeds.</ab>
<ab n="23">And when he
was full forty yeres old, it came into his heart to visit his
brethren the children of Israel.</ab>

<fw>Steuen repeateth the historie of Israel,
reproueth them, and is stoned</fw>
<ab n="24">And seeing one
of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and auenged him that was
oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:<note> Exo.2.11.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">For he
supposed his brethren would haue vnderstood, how that God by his
hand would deliuer them, but they vnderstood not.</ab>
<ab n="26">And the next
day he shewed himselfe vnto them as they stroue, and would haue set
them at one againe, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren, Why doe yee
wrong one to another?<note> Exo.2.13</note></ab>
<ab n="27">But hee that
did his neighbour wrong, thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a
ruler and a Iudge ouer vs?</ab>
<ab n="28">Wilt thou kill
me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?</ab>
<ab n="29">Then fled
Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian,
where he begate two sonnes.</ab>
<ab n="30">And when
fourtie yeeres were expired, there appeared to him in the wildernes
of mount Sina, an Angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a
bush.<note> Exod.3.2</note></ab>
<ab n="31">When Moses saw
it, he wondred at the sight: and as he drew neere to behold it, the
voyce of the Lord came vnto him,</ab>
<ab n="32">Saying, I am
the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac,
and the God of Iacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not
behold.</ab>
<ab n="33">Then said the
Lord to him, Put off thy shooes from thy feet: for the place where
thou standest, is holy ground.</ab>
<ab n="34">I haue seene,
I haue seene the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I
haue heard their groning, &amp; am come downe to deliuer them: And
now come, I will send thee into Egypt.</ab>
<ab n="35">This Moses
whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a Iudge? the
same did God send to bee a ruler and a deliuerer, by the handes of
the Angel which appeared to him in the bush.</ab>
<ab n="36">He brought
them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signes in the land
of Egypt, and in the red Sea, and in the wildernesse fortie
yeeres.<note> Exod.7.9. , Exo.16.1</note></ab>
<ab n="37">¶ This is
that Moses which said vnto the children of Israel, A Prophet shall
the Lord your God raise vp vnto you of your brethren, like vnto
mee: him shall ye heare.<note> Deut.18.15. , Or, as my selfe.</note></ab>

<fw>Steuen repeateth the historie of Israel,
reproueth them, and is stoned</fw>
<ab n="38">This is he
that was in þe Church in the wildernesse with the
Angel, which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers:
who receiued the liuely oracles, to giue vnto vs.<note> Exo.19.3</note></ab>
<ab n="39">To whom our
fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their
hearts turned backe againe into Egypt,</ab>
<ab n="40">Saying vnto
Aaron, Make vs gods to goe before vs. For as for this Moses, which
brought vs out of the land of Egypt, we wote not what is become of
him.<note> Exod.32. 1.</note></ab>
<ab n="41">And they made
a calfe in those dayes, and offered sacrifice vnto the idole, and
reioyced in the workes of their owne hands.</ab>
<ab n="42">Then God
turned, and gaue them vp to worship the hoste of heauen, as it is
written in the booke of the Prophets, O ye house of Israel, haue ye
offered to me slaine beasts, and sacrifices, by the space of fourty
yeeres in the wildernesse?<note> Amos 5.25.</note></ab>
<ab n="43">Yea, ye tooke
vp the Tabernacle of Moloch, and the starre of your God Remphan,
figures which ye made, to worship them: and I will carie you away
beyond Babylon.</ab>
<ab n="44">Our fathers
had the Tabernacle of witnesse in the wildernesse, as hee had
appointed, speaking vnto Moses, that he should make it according to
the fashion that he had seene.<note> Exod. 25. 40.</note></ab>
<ab n="45">Which also our
fathers that came after, brought in with Iesus into the possession
of the Gentiles, whom God draue out before the face of our fathers,
vnto the dayes of Dauid,</ab>
<ab n="46">Who found
fauour before God, and desired to find a Tabernacle for the God of
Iacob.</ab>
<ab n="47">But Solomon
built him an house.<note> 1.Chro. 17.12.</note></ab>
<ab n="48">Howbeit the
most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands, as saith the
Prophet,<note> Chap. 17. 24.</note></ab>
<ab n="49">Heauen is my
throne, and earth is my footestoole: What house will ye build me,
saith the Lord? Or what is the place of my rest?</ab>
<ab n="50">Hath not my
hand made all these things?</ab>
<ab n="51">¶ Ye
stifnecked and vncircumcised in heart, and eares, ye doe alwayes
resist the holy Ghost? as your fathers did, so doe ye.</ab>

<fw>Steuen repeateth the historie of Israel,
reproueth them, and is stoned</fw>
<ab n="52">Which of the
Prophets haue not your fathers persecuted? And they haue slaine
them which shewed before of the comming of the Iust one, of whom ye
haue bene now the betrayers and murderers:</ab>
<ab n="53">Who haue
receiued the Lawe by the disposition of Angels, and haue not kept
it.</ab>
<ab n="54">¶ When
they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they
gnashed on him with their teeth.</ab>
<ab n="55">But hee being
full of the holy Ghost, looked vp stedfastly into heauen, and saw
the glory of God, and Iesus standing on the right hand of
God,</ab>
<ab n="56">And said,
Behold, I see the heauens opened, and the Sonne of man standing on
the right hand of God.</ab>
<ab n="57">Then they
cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their eares, and ran vpon
him with one accord,</ab>
<ab n="58">And cast him
out of the citie, and stoned him: and the witnesses layd downe
their clothes at a yong mans feete, whose name was Saul.</ab>
<ab n="59">And they
stoned Steuen, calling vpon God, and saying, Lord Iesus receiue my
spirit.</ab>
<ab n="60">And he kneeled
downe, and cried with a loud voice, Lord lay not this sinne to
their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleepe.</ab>
