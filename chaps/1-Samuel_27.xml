<ab n="1">And Dauid sayd
in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there
is nothing better for me, then that I should speedily escape into

me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his
hand.<note> Hebr. be consumed.</note></ab>

<ab n="5">¶ And Dauid
said vnto Achish, If I haue now found grace in thine eyes, let them
giue mee a place in some towne in the countrey, that I may dwel
there: for why should thy seruant dwell in the royall citie with

said, Whither haue ye made a rode to day? And Dauid said, Against
the South of Iudah, and against the South of the Ierahmeelites, and
against the South of the Kenites.<note> Or, did you not make a rode, &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And Dauid saued

Philistines.</ab>
<ab n="12">And Achish
