<head>CHAP. XV.</head>
<head>1 God encourageth Abram. 2 Abram
complaineth for want of an heire. 4 God promiseth him a sonne, and
a multiplying of his seed. 6 Abram is iustified by faith. 7 Canaan
is promised againe, and confirmed by a signe, 12 and a
vision.</head>

things, the word of the LORD came vnto Abram in a vision, saying;
Feare not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great
reward.<note> Psal.16.16</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And Abram said,
Lord GOD, what wilt thou giue me, seeing I goe childlesse? and the
steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus.</ab>
<ab n="3">And Abram said;
Behold, to mee thou hast given no seed: and loe, one borne in my
house is mine heire.</ab>
<ab n="4">And behold, the
word of the LORD came vnto him, saying; This shall not be thine
heire: but he that shall come foorth out of thy owne bowels, shalbe
thine heire.</ab>
<ab n="5">And he brought
him forth abroad, and said, Looke now towards heauen, and tell the
starres, if thou be able to number them. And hee said vnto him, So
shall thy seed be.<note> Rom.4. 18.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">And he beleeued
in the LORD; and hee counted it to him for
righteousnesse.<note> Rom.4.3. galat.3.6. iam.2.23.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">And he said vnto
him; I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Caldees, to
give thee this land, to inherit it.</ab>
<ab n="8">And he said, Lord
GOD, whereby shal I know that I shall inherit it?</ab>
<ab n="9">And he said vnto
him, Take me an heifer of three yeeres old, and a shee goat of
three yeeres old, and a ramme of three yeeres old, and a turtle
doue, and a yong pigeon.</ab>

vnto him all these, and diuided them in the midst, and layd each

Abram, Know of a surety, that thy seed shalbe a stranger, in a land
that is not theirs, and shal serue them, and they shall afflict
them foure hundred yeeres.<note> Acts 7.6.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And also that
nation whom they shall serue, wil I iudge: and afterward shall they
come out with great substance.</ab>
<ab n="15">And thou shalt
goe to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old
