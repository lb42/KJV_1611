<head>CHAP.
XXVIII.</head>
<head>1 Paul, after his shipwracke is
kindly entertained of the Barbarians. 5 The viper on his hand
hurteth him not. 8 He healeth many diseases in the Iland. 11 They
depart towards Rome. 17 Hee declareth to the Iewes the cause of his
comming. 14 After his preaching some were perswaded, and some
beleeued not. 30 Yet he preacheth there two yeeres.</head>

<ab n="1">And when they
were escaped, then they knew that the Iland was called
Melita.</ab>
<ab n="2">And the
barbarous people shewed vs no little kindnesse: for they kindled a
fire, and receiued vs euery one because of the present raine, and
because of the cold.</ab>

<fw>The Viper.</fw>
<ab n="3">And when Paul
had gathered a bundle of stickes, and layde them on the fire, there
came a Uiper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</ab>
<ab n="4">And when the
Barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they saide
among themselues, No doubt this man is a murtherer, whom though hee
hath escaped the Sea, yet Uengeance suffereth not to liue.</ab>
<ab n="5">And hee shooke
off the beast into the fire, and felt no harme.</ab>
<ab n="6">Howbeit, they
looked when hee should haue swollen, or fallen downe dead suddenly:
but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harme come to
him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a God.</ab>
<ab n="7">In the same
quarters were possessions of the chiefe man of the Iland, whose
name was Publius, who receiued vs, and lodged vs three dayes
courteously.</ab>
<ab n="8">And it came to
passe that the father of Publius lay sicke of a feuer, and of a
bloody-flixe, to whom Paul entred in, and prayed, and layed his
hands on him, and healed him.</ab>
<ab n="9">So when this
was done, others also which had diseases in the Iland, came, and
were healed:</ab>
<ab n="10">Who also honoured
vs with many honours, and when wee departed, they laded vs with
such things as were necessary.</ab>
<ab n="11">And after three
moneths wee departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in
the Ile, whose signe was Castor and Pollux.</ab>
<ab n="12">And landing at
Syracuse wee taried there three dayes.</ab>
<ab n="13">And from thence wee
fet a compasse, and came to Rhegium, and after one day the South
winde blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</ab>
<ab n="14">Where wee found
brethren, and were desired to tary with them seuen dayes: and so we
went toward Rome.</ab>
<ab n="15">And from thence,
when the brethren heard of vs, they came to meet vs as farre as
Appii forum, and the three Tauernes: whom when Paul saw, he thanked
God, and tooke courage.</ab>
<ab n="16">And when we came to
Rome, the Centurion deliuered the prisoners to the Captaine of the
guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himselfe, with a souldier
that kept him.</ab>

<fw>Israels hope.</fw>
<ab n="17">And it came to
passe, that after three dayes, Paul called the chiefe of the Iewes
together. And when they were come together, he said vnto them, Men
and brethren, though I haue committed nothing against the people,
or customes of our fathers, yet was I deliuered prisoner from
Hierusalem into the hands of the Romanes.</ab>
<ab n="18">Who when they had
examined me, would haue let me goe, because there was no cause of
death in me.</ab>
<ab n="19">But when the Iewes
spake against it, I was constrained to appeale vnto Cesar, not that
I had ought to accuse my nation of.</ab>
<ab n="20">For this cause
therefore haue I called for you, to see you, and to speake with
you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this
chaine.</ab>
<ab n="21">And they saide vnto
him, Wee neither receiued letters out of Iudea concerning thee,
neither any of the brethren that came, shewed or spake any harme of
thee.</ab>
<ab n="22">But we desire to
heare of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we
know that euery where it is spoken against.</ab>
<ab n="23">And when they had
appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging, to
whom he expounded and testified the kingdome of God, perswading
them concerning Iesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the
Prophets, from morning till euening.</ab>

<fw>Obstinate Iewes.</fw>
<ab n="24">And some beleeued
the things which were spoken, and some beleeued not.</ab>
<ab n="25">And when they
agreed not among themselues, they departed, after that Paul had
spoken one word, Well spake the holy Ghost by Esaias the Prophet,
vnto our fathers,</ab>
<ab n="26">Saying, Goe vnto
this people, and say, Hearing ye shall heare, and shall not
vnderstand, and seeing ye shall see, and not perceiue.<note> Esai. 6. 9. mat. 13.14. mar.4.12. luke 8.4. ioh.12.40. rom.11.8.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">For the heart of
this people is waxed grosse, and their eares are dull of hearing,
and their eyes haue they closed, lest they should with their eyes,
and heare with their eares, and vnderstand with their heart, and
should bee conuerted, and I should heale them.</ab>
<ab n="28">Be it knowen
therfore vnto you, that the saluation of God is sent vnto the
Gentiles, and that they wil heare it.</ab>
<ab n="29">And when hee had
saide these words, the Iewes departed, and had great reasoning
among themselues.</ab>
<ab n="30">And Paul dwelt two
whole yeeres in his owne hired house, and receiued all that came in
vnto him,</ab>
<ab n="31">Preaching the
kingdome of God, and teaching those things which concerne the Lord
Iesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</ab>
