<head>CHAP.
LXVI.</head>
<head>1 The glorious God will be serued in
humble sinceritie. 5 He comforteth the humble with the marueilous
generation, 10 and with the gracious benefits of the Church. 15
Gods seuere iudgements against the wicked. 19 The Gentiles shall
haue an holy Church, 24 and see the damnation of the
wicked.</head>

<ab n="1">Thus sayth the
Lord, The heauen is my throne, and the earth is my footestoole:
where is the house that yee builde vnto mee? and where is the place
of my rest?<note> 1.Kings 8. 27. 2.cor.6. 18. actes 7. 49. and 17.24.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">For all those
things hath mine hand made, and all those things haue beene, saith
the Lord: but to this man wil I looke, euen to him that is poore
and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.</ab>

<fw>Her glory.</fw>
<ab n="3">He that killeth an
oxe is as if he slue a man: he that sacrificeth a lambe, as if he
cut off a dogs necke: he that offereth an oblation, as if he
offered swines blood: he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an
idole: yea, they haue chosen their owne wayes, and their soule
delighteth in their abominations.<note> Or, kidde. , Heb. maketh a memoriall of.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">I also will chuse
their delusions, and will bring their feares vpon them; because
when I called, none did answere, when I spake they did not heare:
but they did euill before mine eyes, and chose that in which I
delighted not.<note> Or, deuices. , Pro. 1.24. iere.7.13. , Chap.65. 12.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">Â¶ Heare the
word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word: Your brethren that
hated you, that cast you out for my Names sake, sayd, Let the Lord
be glorified: but he shal appeare to your ioy, and they shalbe
ashamed.<note> Cha.5.19.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">A voice of noyse
from the city, a voice from the Temple, a voice of the Lord, that
rendreth recompense to his enemies.</ab>
<ab n="7">Before she
trauailed, she brought foorth: before her paine came, shee was
deliuered of a man childe.</ab>
<ab n="8">Who hath heard
such a thing? who hath seene such things? shall the earth be made
to bring forth in one day, or shall a nation be borne at once? for
as soone as Zion traueiled, shee brought foorth her
children.</ab>
<ab n="9">Shall I bring to
the birth, &amp; not cause to bring forth, saith the Lord ? shall I
cause to bring foorth, and shut the wombe, sayth thy
God?<note> Or, beget.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">Reioyce ye with
Ierusalem, and be glad with her, all yee that loue her: reioyce for
ioy with her, all yee that mourne for her:</ab>
<ab n="11">That ye may sucke
and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations: that ye may
milke out, and be delighted with the abundance of her
glory.<note> Or, brightnesse.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">For thus sayth
the Lord, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a riuer, and the
glory of the Gentiles like a flowing streame: then shall ye sucke,
ye shalbe borne vpon her sides, and be dandled vpon her
knees.<note> Isai 49.22. and 60.4.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">As one whom his
mother comforteth, so wil I comfort you: and ye shall be comforted
in Ierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="14">And when yee see
this, your heart shall reioyce, and your bones shall flourish like
an herbe: and the hand of the Lord shall be knowen towards his
seruants, and his indignation towards his enemies.</ab>

<fw>The restoring of the Church.</fw>
<ab n="15">For behold, the
Lord wil come with fire, and with his charets like a whirlewinde,
to render his anger with furie, and his rebuke with flames of
fire.</ab>
<ab n="16">For by fire and
by his sword, will the Lord plead with all flesh: and the slaine of
the Lord shalbe many.</ab>
<ab n="17">They that
sanctifie themselues, and purifie themselues in the gardens,
behinde one tree in the midst, eating swines flesh, and the
abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the
Lord.<note> Or, one after another.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">For I know their
works and their thoughts: it shall come that I will gather all
nations and tongues, and they shall come and see my glorie.</ab>
<ab n="19">And I will set a
signe among them, and I will send those that escape of them vnto
the nations, to Tarshish, Pul and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal
and Iauan, to the Iles afarre off, that haue not heard my fame,
neither haue seene my glory, and they shall declare my glory among
the Gentiles.</ab>

<fw>The restoring of the Church.</fw>
<ab n="20">And they shall
bring all your brethren for an offering vnto the Lord, out of all
nations, vpon horses and in charets, and in litters, and vpon
mules, and vpon swift beasts to my holie mountaine Ierusalem, saith
the Lord; as the children of Israel bring an offering in a cleane
vessell, into the house of the Lord.<note> Or, coaches.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">And I will also
take of them for Priestes and for Leuites, saith the
Lord.<note> Exod.19.6. chap.61.6. 1.pet.2. 9. reuel.1.6.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">For as the new
heauens, and the new earth which I wil make, shall remaine before
me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name
remaine.<note> Chap.65. 17. 2.Pet.3. 13. reuel. 21.1.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">And it shall come
to passe, that from one new Moone to an other, and from one Sabbath
to an other, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the
Lord.<note> Heb. from new Moone to his new Moone, and from Sabbath to his Sabbath.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">And they shall
goe foorth, and looke vpon the carkeises of the men that haue
transgressed against me: for their worme shall not die, neither
shall their fire be quenched, and they shall be an abhorring vnto
all flesh.<note> Marke 9. 44.</note></ab>
