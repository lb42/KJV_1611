<head>CHAP.
III.</head>
<head>1 Iohn preacheth: his office: life,
and Baptisme. 7 He reprehendeth the Pharises, 13 and baptizeth
Christ in Iordane.</head>

<ab n="1">In those daies
came Iohn the Baptist, preaching in the wildernesse of
Iudea,<note> Marke 1. 4 luke 3.2.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And saying, Repent
yee: for the kingdome of heauen is at hand.</ab>
<ab n="3">For this is he
that was spoken of by the Prophet Esaias, saying, The voyce of one
crying in the wildernes, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his
paths straight.<note> Esay 40. 3. marke 1. 3.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">And the same Iohn
had his raiment of camels haire, and a leatherne girdle about his
loynes, and his meate was locusts and wilde hony.</ab>
<ab n="5">Then went out to
him Hierusalem, and all Iudea, and all the region round about
Iordane,</ab>
<ab n="6">And were baptized
of him in Iordane, confessing their sinnes.</ab>
<ab n="7">¶ But when he
saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his Baptisme, he
said vnto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee
from the wrath to come?<note> 1.Cha.12. 34.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Bring forth
therefore fruits meet for repentance.<note> Or, answerable to amendment of life.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And thinke not to
say within your selues, Wee haue Abraham to our father: For I say
vnto you, that God is able of these stones to raise vp children
vnto Abraham.<note> Iohn 18. 39.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">And now also the
axe is layd vnto the root of the trees: Therefore euery tree which
bringeth not foorth good fruite, is hewen downe, and cast into the
fire.<note> Chap.7. 19.</note></ab>

<fw>Christ baptized.</fw>
<ab n="11">I indeed baptize
you with water vnto repentance: but he that commeth after mee, is
mightier then I, whose shooes I am not worthy to beare, hee shall
baptize you with the holy Ghost, and with fire.<note> Mark.1.8. iohn 1. 26. luke 3. 16.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">Whose fanne is in
his hand, and he will throughly purge his floore, and gather his
wheat into the garner: but wil burne vp the chaffe with
vnquenchable fire.</ab>
<ab n="13">¶ Then
commeth Iesus from Galilee to Iordane, vnto Iohn, to be baptized of
him:<note> Mark. 1.9. luke 3.21.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">But Iohn forbade
him, saying, I haue need to bee baptized of thee, and commest thou
to me?</ab>
<ab n="15">And Iesus
answering, said vnto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it
becommeth vs to fulfill all righteousnesse. Then he suffered
him.</ab>
<ab n="16">And Iesus, when
hee was baptized, went vp straightway out of the water: and loe,
the heauens were opened vnto him, and he saw the Spirit of God
descending like a doue, and lighting vpon him.</ab>
<ab n="17">And loe, a voice
from heauen, saying, This is my beloued Sonne, in whom I am well
pleased.</ab>
