<head>1 The iudgement of Pharaoh, for his
treachery to Israel. 8 The desolation of Egypt. 13 The restauration

<ab n="1">In the tenth
yeere, in the tenth moneth, in the twelft day of the moneth, the
word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,</ab>
<ab n="2">Sonne of man, set
thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophecie against him,
and against all Egypt.</ab>
<ab n="3">Speake and say,
Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of
Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the middest of his riuers,
which hath saide, My riuer is mine owne, and I haue made it for my
selfe.<note> Psal.74.13,14. isa.27.1. &amp; 51.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">But I will put
hookes in thy chawes, and I will cause the fish of thy riuers to
sticke vnto thy scales, and I will bring thee vp out of the middest
of thy riuers, and all the fish of thy riuers shall sticke vnto thy
scales.</ab>
<ab n="5">And I will leaue
thee throwen into the wildernes, thee and all the fish of thy
riuers: thou shalt fall vpon the open fields, thou shalt not be
brought together, nor gathered: I haue giuen thee for meat to the
beastes of the field, and to the foules of the heauen.<note> Heb. face of the field.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">And all the
inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the Lord, because they
haue bene a staffe of reede to the house of Israel.<note> 2.Kings 18.21. isa. 36.6.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">When they tooke
hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst breake, and rent all their
shoulder: and when they leaned vpon thee, thou brakest, and madest
all their loynes to be at a stand.</ab>
<ab n="8">¶ Therefore
thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will bring a sword vpon thee,
and cut off man and beast out of thee.</ab>
<ab n="9">And the land of
Egypt shalbe desolate and waste, and they shall knowe that I am the
Lord: because he hath saide, The riuer is mine, and I haue made
it.</ab>

<fw>Egypt desolate.</fw>
<ab n="10">Beholde
therefore, I am against thee, and against thy riuers, and I wil
make the land of Egypt vtterly waste and desolate, from the towre
of Syene euen vnto the border of Ethiopia.<note> Heb. wastes of waste. , Heb. Seueneh.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">No foot of man
shal passe through it, nor foote of beast shall passe through it,
neither shall it bee inhabited fourtie yeeres.</ab>
<ab n="12">And I will make
the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countreys that are
desolate, and her cities among the cities that are layed waste,
shall be desolate fourtie yeeres: and I will scatter the Egyptians
among the nations, and wil disperse them through the
countreys.</ab>
<ab n="13">¶ Yet thus
saith the Lord God, At the end of fourtie yeeres will I gather the
Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered.<note> Isai. 19. 23. ier.46. 26.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And I will bring
againe the captiuitie of Egypt, and will cause them to returne into
the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation, and they
shall be there a base kingdome.<note> Or, birth. , Heb. low.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">It shall be the
basest of the kingdomes, neither shall it exalt it selfe any more
aboue the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no
more rule ouer the nations.</ab>
<ab n="16">And it shall be
no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth their
iniquity to remembrance, when they shall looke after them: but they
shall know that I am the Lord God.</ab>
<ab n="17">¶ And it
came to passe in the seuen and twentieth yeere, in the first
moneth, in the first day of the moneth, the worde of the Lord came
vnto me, saying,</ab>
<ab n="18">Sonne of man,
Nebuchad-rezzar king of Babylon caused his armie to serue a great
seruice against Tyrus: euery head was made balde, and euery
shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his armie for Tyrus,
for the seruice that he had serued against it.</ab>
<ab n="19">Therefore thus
saith the Lord God, Behold, I will giue the land of Egypt vnto
Nebuchad-rezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take her multitude,
and take her spoile, and take her praye, and it shall be the wages
for his armie.<note> Heb. spoile her spoile and pray her pray.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">I haue giuen him
the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he serued against it,
because they wrought for me, saith the Lord God.<note> Or, for his hire.</note></ab>

<fw>The desolation of Egypt.</fw>
<ab n="21">¶ In that
day will I cause the horne of the house of Israel to budde forth,
and I will giue thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them,
and they shal know that I am the Lord.</ab>
