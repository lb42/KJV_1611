<head>CHAP. IV.</head>
<head>1 From particular admonitions 4 hee
proceedeth to generall exhortations, 10 shewing how hee reioyced at
their liberalitie towards him lying in prison, not so much for the
supply of his owne wants, as for the grace of God in them. 19 And
so he concludeth with prayer and salutations.</head>


<fw>Booke of life.</fw>
<ab n="1">Therefore, my
brethren, dearely beloued and longed for, my ioy and crowne, so
stand fast in the Lord, my dearely beloued.</ab>
<ab n="2">I beseech
Euodias, and beseech Syntiche, that they be of the same mind in the
Lord.</ab>
<ab n="3">And I entreat
thee also, true yokefellow, helpe those women which laboured with
me in the Gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellow
labourers, whose names are in the booke of life.</ab>
<ab n="4">Reioyce in the
Lord alway: and againe I say, Reioyce.</ab>
<ab n="5">Let your
moderation be knowen vnto all men. The Lord is at hand.</ab>
<ab n="6">Bee carefull
for nothing: but in euery thing by prayer and supplication with
thankesgiuing, let your request be made knowen vnto God.</ab>
<ab n="7">And the peace
of God which passeth all vnderstanding, shall keepe your hearts
&amp; minds through Christ Iesus.</ab>
<ab n="8">Finally,
brethren, whatsoeuer things are true, whatsoeuer things are honest,
whatsoeuer things are iust, whatsoeuer things are pure, whatsoeuer
things are louely, whatsoeuer things are of good report: if there
bee any vertue, and if there bee any praise, thinke on these
things:<note> Or, venerable.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">Those things
which ye haue both learned and receiued, and heard, and seene in
mee, doe: and the God of peace shall be with you.</ab>
<ab n="10">But I
reioyced in the Lorde greatly, that now at the last your care of me
hath flourished againe, wherein yee were also carefull, but ye
lacked opportunitie.<note> Or, is reuiued.</note></ab>

<fw>Contentation.</fw>
<ab n="11">Not that I
speake in respect of want: for I haue learned in whatsoeuer state I
am, therewith to bee content.</ab>
<ab n="12">I know both
how to bee abased, and I knowe how to abound: euerie where, and in
all things I am instructed, both to bee full, and to bee hungrie,
both to abound, and to suffer need.</ab>
<ab n="13">I can do all
things through Christ, which strengtheneth me.</ab>
<ab n="14">Notwithstanding,
yee haue well done, that ye did communicate with my
affliction.</ab>
<ab n="15">Now ye
Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the Gospel, when I
departed from Macedonia, no Church communicated with mee, as
concerning giuing and receiuing, but ye onely.</ab>
<ab n="16">For euen in
Thessalonica, ye sent once, and againe vnto my necessitie.</ab>
<ab n="17">Not because I
desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your
account.</ab>
<ab n="18">But I haue
all, and abound. I am full, hauing receiued of Epaphroditus the
things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a
sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.<note> Or, I haue receiued all.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">But my God
shall supply all your need, according to his riches in glory, by
Christ Iesus.</ab>
<ab n="20">Now vnto God
and our Father be glory for euer and euer. Amen.</ab>
<ab n="21">Salute euery
Saint in Christ Iesus: the brethren which are with me, greet
you.</ab>
<ab n="22">All the
Saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Cesars
houshold.</ab>
<ab n="23">The grace of
our Lord Iesus Christ be with you all. Amen. It was written to the
Philippians from Rome, by Epaphroditus.</ab>
