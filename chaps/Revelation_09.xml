<head>CHAP. IX.</head>
<head>1 At the sounding of the fift Angel,
a starre falleth from heauen, to whom is giuen the key of the
bottomles pit. 2 He openeth the pit, and there come forth Locusts
like Scorpions. 12 The first woe past. 13 The sixt Trumpet
soundeth. 14 Foure Angels are let loose, that were
bound.</head>

<ab n="1">And the fift
Angel sounded, and I saw a starre fall from heauen vnto the earth:
and to him was giuen the key of the bottomlesse pitte.</ab>
<ab n="2">And hee opened
the bottomelesse pit, and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as
the smoke of a great fornace, and the sunne and the ayre were
darkened, by reason of the smoke of the pit.</ab>
<ab n="3">And there came
out of the smoke locusts vpon the earth, and vnto them was giuen
power, as the Scorpions of the earth haue power.</ab>
<ab n="4">And it was
commaunded them that they should not hurt the grasse of the earth,
neither any greene thing, neither any tree: but only those men
which haue not the seale of God in their foreheads.</ab>
<ab n="5">And to them it
was giuen that they should not kill them, but that they should be
tormented fiue moneths, and their torment was as the torment of a
Scorpion, when he striketh a man.</ab>
<ab n="6">And in those
daies shal men seeke death, and shall not finde it, and shall
desire to die, and death shall flee from them.</ab>
<ab n="7">And the shapes
of the Locusts were like vnto horses prepared vnto battell, and on
their heades were as it were crownes like golde, and their faces
were as the faces of men.</ab>
<ab n="8">And they had
haire as the haire of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of
Lions.</ab>

<fw>One woe is past.</fw>
<ab n="9">And they had
brestplates, as it were brestplates of iron, and the sound of their
wings was as the sound of charets of many horses running to
battell.</ab>
<ab n="10">And they had
tayles like vnto Scorpions, and there were stings in their tayles:
and their power was to hurt men fiue moneths.</ab>
<ab n="11">And they had a
king ouer them, which is the Angel of the bottomlesse pit, whose
name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greeke tongue hath
his name Apollyon.<note> That is to say, A destroyer.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">One woe is
past, and behold there come two woes more hereafter.</ab>
<ab n="13">And the sixt
Angel sounded, and I heard a voyce from the foure hornes of
Ã¾e golden altar, which is before God,</ab>
<ab n="14">Saying to the
sixt Angel which had the trumpet, Loose the foure Angels which are
bound in the great riuer Euphrates.</ab>
<ab n="15">And the foure
Angels were loosed, which were prepared for an houre, and a day,
and a moneth, and a yeere, for to slay the third part of
men.<note> Or, at.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">And the number
of the armie of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand:
and I heard the number of them.</ab>
<ab n="17">And thus I
sawe the horses in the vision, and them that sate on them, hauing
brest-plates of fire and of Iacinct, and brimstone, &amp; the
heades of the horses were as the heads of Lions, and out of their
mouthes issued fire, and smoke, and brimstone.</ab>
<ab n="18">By these three
was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke,
and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouthes.</ab>
<ab n="19">For their
power is in their mouth, and in their tailes: for their tailes were
like vnto serpents, and had heads, and with them they doe
hurt.</ab>
<ab n="20">And the rest
of the men which were not killed by these plagues, yet repented not
of the works of their hands, that they should not worship deuils,
and idoles of golde, and siluer, and brasse, and stone, and of
wood, which neither can see, nor heare, nor walke:<note> Psal. 115. 4. &amp; 135. 15.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">Neither
repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of
their fornication, nor of their thefts.</ab>
