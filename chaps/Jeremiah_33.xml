<ab n="1">Moreouer, the
word of the Lord came vnto Ieremiah the second time (while hee was
yet shut vp in the court of the prison) saying;<note> Chap.32. 23.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">Thus saith the
Lord the maker thereof, the Lord that formed it, to establish it,
the Lord is his Name.<note> Isa.37. 26.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">Call vnto me,
and I will answere thee, and shew thee great and mightie things,
which thou knowest not.<note> Or, hidden.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">For thus sayth
the Lord the God of Israel concerning the houses of this citie, and
concerning the houses of the kings of Iudah, which are throwen
downe by the mounts, and by the sword.</ab>

<fw>Sinnes forgiuen.</fw>
<ab n="5">They come to
fight with the Caldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead
bodies of men, whome I haue slaine in mine anger, and in my fury,
and for all whose wickednesse I haue hid my face from this
citie.</ab>
<ab n="6">Behold, I will
bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and wil reueale
vnto them the abundance of peace, and trueth.</ab>
<ab n="7">And I will cause
the captiuitie of Iudah, and the captiuitie of Israel to returne,
and will build them as at the first.</ab>
<ab n="8">And I will
clense them from all their iniquitie, whereby they haue sinned
against mee: and I will pardon all their iniquities whereby they
haue sinned, and whereby they haue transgressed against
me.<note> Chap.21. 34. mic. 7. 18.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">¶ And it
shall be to me a name of ioy, a praise and an honour before all the
nations of the earth, which shall heare all the good that I doe
vnto them: and they shall feare and tremble for all the goodnesse,
and for all the prosperitie that I procure vnto it.</ab>
<ab n="10">Thus saith the
Lord; Againe there shall be heard in this place (which yee say
shalbe desolate without man and without beast, euen in the cities
of Iudah, and in the streetes of Ierusalem that are desolate
without man and without inhabitant, &amp; without beast.)</ab>
<ab n="11">The voyce of
ioy and the voyce of gladnesse, the voyce of the bridegroome, and
the voyce of the bride, the voyce of them that shall say; Praise
the Lord of hostes, for the Lord is good, for his mercy endureth
for euer, and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into
the house of the Lord; for I will cause to returne the captiuitie
of the land, as at the first, saith the Lord.<note> Chap.7. 34. and 16. 19.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">Thus saith the
Lord of hostes; Againe in this place which is desolate without man
and without beast, and in all the cities thereof shalbe a
habitation of shepheards causing their flockes to lie
downe.</ab>
<ab n="13">In the cities
of the mountaines, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of
the South, and in the land of Beniamin, and in the places about
Ierusalem, and in the cities of Iudah, shall the flockes passe
againe vnder the hands of him that telleth them, saith the
Lord.</ab>

<fw>Gods couenant.</fw>
<ab n="14">Behold, the
dayes come, saith the Lord, that I will performe that good thing
which I haue promised vnto the house of Israel, and to the house of
Iudah.</ab>
<ab n="15">¶ In those
dayes, and at that time will I cause the branch of righteousnesse
to grow vp vnto Dauid, and he shall execute iudgement and
righteousnesse in the land.<note> Chap. 23. 5. isai. 11.1. and 4.2.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">In those dayes
shall Iudah be saued, and Ierusalem shall dwell safely, and this is
the name wherewith she shall be called, The Lord our
righteousnesse.<note> Heb. Iehoua-tsidkenu.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">¶ For thus
saith the Lord; Dauid shall neuer want a man to sit vpon the throne
of the house of Israel.<note> Heb. there shall not be cut off from Dauid. , 2.Sam.7. 16. 1.kings. 2.4.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Neither shall
the priests the Leuites want a man before me to offer burnt
offrings, and to kindle meate offrings, and to doe sacrifice
continually.</ab>
<ab n="19">¶ And the
word of the Lord came vnto Ieremiah, saying,</ab>
<ab n="20">Thus saith the
Lord; If you can breake my couenant of the day, and my couenant of
the night, and that there should not be day, and night in their
season:<note> Chap. 31. 36. isai. 54. 9.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">Then may also
my couenant bee broken with Dauid my seruant, that he should not
haue a sonne to reigne vpon his throne; and with the Leuites the
priests my ministers.</ab>
<ab n="22">As the hoste of
heauen cannot be numbred, neither the sand of the sea measured: so
will I multiply the seede of Dauid my seruant, and the Leuites that
minister vnto me.<note> Chap. 31. 37.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">Moreouer, the
word of the Lord came to Ieremiah, saying;</ab>
<ab n="24">Considerest
thou not what this people haue spoken, saying; The two families,
which the Lord hath chosen, he hath euen cast them off? thus they
haue dispised my people, that they should be no more a nation
before them.</ab>
<ab n="25">Thus saith the
Lord; If my couenant be not with day and night, and if I haue not
appointed the ordinances of heauen and earth:</ab>
<ab n="26">Then will I
cast away the seede of Iacob and Dauid my seruant, so that I will
not take any of his seede to be rulers ouer the seede of Abraham,
Isaac and Iacob: for I will cause their captiuitie to returne, and
haue mercie on them.</ab>
