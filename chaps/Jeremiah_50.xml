<head>CHAP. L.</head>
<head>1. 9.21. 35. The iudgement of
Babylon. 4.17. 33. The redemption of Israel.</head>

<ab n="1">The word that
the Lord spake against Babylon, and against the land of the
Caldeans by Ieremiah the Prophet.<note> Hebr. by the hand of Ieremiah.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">Declare yee
among the nations, and publish, and set vp a standart, publish and
conceale not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is
broken in pieces, her idols are confounded, her Images are broken
in pieces.<note> Hebr. lift vp.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">For out of the
North there commeth vp a nation against her, which shall make her
land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remoue,
they shall depart both man and beast.</ab>
<ab n="4">¶ In those
daies, and in that time, saith the Lord, the children of Israel
shall come, they, and the children of Iudah together, going and
weeping: they shall goe, and seeke the Lord their God.</ab>

<fw>The destruction of Babylon.</fw>
<ab n="5">They shall aske
the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let
vs ioyne our selues to the Lord, in a perpetuall Couenant that
shall not be forgotten.</ab>
<ab n="6">My people hath
bene lost sheepe: their shepheards haue caused them to goe astray,
they haue turned them away on the mountaines: they haue gone from
mountaine to hill, they haue forgotten their resting
place.<note> Hebr. place to lye downe in.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">All that found
them haue deuoured them, and their aduersaries said, We offend not,
because they haue sinned against the Lord, the habitation of
iustice, euen the Lord, the hope of their fathers.</ab>
<ab n="8">Remoue out of
the midst of Babylon, and goe foorth out of the land of the
Caldeans, and be as the hee goats before the flocks.<note> Isai.48. 20. chap. 51.6. reue. 18.4.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">¶ For loe,
I will raise and cause to come vp against Babylon, an assembly of
great nations from the North countrey, and they shall set
themselues in aray against her, from thence shee shalbe taken:
their arrowes shalbe as of a mightie expert man: none shall returne
in vaine.<note> Or, destroyer.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">And Caldea
shall bee a spoile: all that spoile her shall be satisfied, saith
the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="11">Because ye were
glad, because yee reioyced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage,
because ye are growen fat, as the heifer at grasse, and bellow as
bulles:<note> Heb. bigge or corpulent.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">Your mother
shalbe sore confounded, she that bare you shalbe ashamed: beholde,
the hindermost of the nations shalbe a wildernes, a dry land, &amp;
a desert.</ab>
<ab n="13">Because of the
wrath of the Lord, it shall not be inhabited, but it shalbe wholly
desolate: euery one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and
hisse at all her plagues.<note> Chap.49. 17.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">Put your selues
in aray against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow,
shoot at her; spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the
Lord,</ab>
<ab n="15">Shout against
her round about: shee hath giuen her hand: her foundations are
fallen, her walls are throwen downe: for it is the vengeance of the
Lord: take vengeance vpon her; as she hath done, doe vnto
her.</ab>

<fw>The destruction of Babylon. The reward of
pride.</fw>
<ab n="16">Cut off the
sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of
haruest: for feare of the oppressing sword, they shall turne euery
one to his people, and they shall flee euery one to his owne
lande.<note> Or, sythe.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">¶ Israel
is a scattered sheepe, the lyons haue driuen him away: first the
king of Assyria hath deuoured him, and last this Nebuchad-rezzar
king of Babylon hath broken his bones.</ab>
<ab n="18">Therefore thus
saith the Lord of hostes the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish
the king of Babylon and his land, as I haue punished the king of
Assyria.</ab>
<ab n="19">And I will
bring Israel againe to his habitation, and he shal feed on Carmel
and Bashan, and his soule shall be satisfied vpon mount Ephraim and
Gilead.</ab>
<ab n="20">In those dayes,
and in that time, sayth the Lord, the iniquitie of Israel shall be
sought for, and there shall be none; and the sinnes of Iudah, and
they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I
reserue.</ab>
<ab n="21">¶ Goe vp
against the land of Merathaim, euen against it, and against the
inhabitants of Pekod: waste and vtterly destroy after them, sayeth
the Lord, and doe according to all that I haue commanded
thee.<note> Or, of the rebels. , Or, visitation.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">A sound of
battell is in the land, and of great destruction.</ab>
<ab n="23">How is the
hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken? how is Babylon
become a desolation among the nations?</ab>
<ab n="24">I haue laide a
snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast
not aware: thou art found and also caught, because thou hast
striuen against the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="25">The Lord hath
opened his armorie, and hath brought foorth the weapons of his
indignation: for this is the worke of the Lord God of hosts, in the
land of the Caldeans.</ab>
<ab n="26">Come against
her from the vtmost border, open her store-houses: cast her vp as
heapes, and destroy her vtterly: let nothing of her be
left.<note> Heb. from the end. , Or, tread her.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">Slay all her
bullocks: let them goe downe to the slaughter: woe vnto them, for
their day is come, the time of their visitation.</ab>
<ab n="28">The voice of
them that flee &amp; escape out of the land of Babylon to declare
in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God, the vengeance of his
Temple.</ab>

<fw>The reward of pride.</fw>
<ab n="29">Call together
the archers against Babylon: all yee that bend the bow, campe
against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her
according to her worke; according to all that shee hath done vnto
her: for shee hath bene proud against the Lord, against the Holy
one of Israel.</ab>
<ab n="30">Therefore shall
her yong men fall in the streets, &amp; all her men of war shall be
cut off in that day, saith the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="31">Behold, I am
against thee, O thou most proud, sayth the Lord God of hostes: for
thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.<note> Heb. pride.</note></ab>
<ab n="32">And the most
proude shall stumble and fall, and none shal raise him vp: and I
will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall deuoure all round
about him.<note> Heb. pride.</note></ab>
<ab n="33">¶ Thus
saith the Lord of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of
Iudah were oppressed together, and all that tooke them captiues,
held them fast, they refused to let them goe.</ab>
<ab n="34">Their Redeemer
is strong, the Lord of hosts is his Name, he shall throughly pleade
their cause, that hee may giue rest to the land, and disquiet the
inhabitants of Babylon.</ab>
<ab n="35">¶ A sword
is vpon the Caldeans, saith the Lord, and vpon the inhabitants of
Babylon, and vpon her princes, and vpon her wise men.</ab>
<ab n="36">A sword is vpon
the lyers, and they shall dote: a sword is vpon her mighty men, and
they shalbe dismayed.<note> Or, chiefe stayes. Heb. barres.</note></ab>
<ab n="37">A sword is vpon
their horses, and vpon their charets, and vpon all the mingled
people that are in the middest of her, and they shall become as
women: a sword is vpon her treasures, and they shall be
robbed.</ab>
<ab n="38">A drought is
vpon her waters, and they shalbe dried vp: for it is the land of
grauen images, and they are madde vpon their idoles.</ab>
<ab n="39">Therefore the
wilde beasts of the desert with the wilde beastes of the Ilands
shall dwel there, and the owles shall dwell therein: &amp; it
shalbe no more inhabited for euer: neither shall it bee dwelt in
frō generation to generation.</ab>
<ab n="40">As God
ouerthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and the neighbour cities thereof,
sayth the Lord: so shall no man abide there, neither shal any sonne
of man dwell therein.<note> Gen.19. 25. chap. 49.18.</note></ab>
<ab n="41">Behold, a
people shall come from the North, and a great nation, and many
kings shall bee raised vp from the coasts of the earth.</ab>

<fw>Fanners sent against Babylon.</fw>
<ab n="42">They shall
holde the bow and the lance: they are cruell and will not shewe
mercy: their voice shall roare like the sea, and they shall ride
vpon horses, euery one put in aray like a man to the battell,
against thee, O daughter of Babylon.</ab>
<ab n="43">The king of
Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble;
anguish tooke hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in
trauell.</ab>
<ab n="44">Behold, he
shall come vp like a lyon from the swelling of Iordan, vnto the
habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly runne away
from her: and who is a chosen man that I may appoint ouer her? for
who is like me, and who will appoint me the time? and who is that
shepheard that will stand before me?<note> Chap.49. 19. , Iob.41.1. chap.49. 19. , Or, conuent me to plead.</note></ab>
<ab n="45">Therefore heare
yee the counsell of the Lord that hee hath taken against Babylon,
and his purposes that he hath purposed against the land of the
Caldeans: surely the least of the flocke shall drawe them out:
surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.</ab>
<ab n="46">At the noise of
the taking of Babylon the earth is moued, and the cry is heard
among the nations.</ab>
