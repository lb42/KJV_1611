<head>CHAP. XI.</head>
<head>1 Peter, being accused for going in
to the Gentiles, 5 maketh his defence, 18 which is accepted. 19 The
Gospel being spread into Phenice and Cyprus, and Antioch, Barnabas
is sent to confirme them. 26 The disciples there are first called
Christians. 27 They send reliefe to the brethren in Iudea in time
of famine.</head>


<fw>Peters vision.</fw>
<ab n="1">And the
Apostles, and brethren that were in Iudea, heard that the Gentiles
had also receiued the word of God.</ab>
<ab n="2">And when Peter
was come vp to Hierusalem, they that were of the circumcision
contended with him,</ab>
<ab n="3">Saying, Thou
wentest in to men vncircumcised, &amp; didst eate with
them.</ab>
<ab n="4">But Peter
rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order
vnto them, saying,</ab>
<ab n="5">I was in the
citie of Ioppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, a certaine
vessell descend, as it had beene a great sheete, let downe from
heauen by foure corners, and it came euen to me.</ab>
<ab n="6">Upon the which
when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw foure footed
beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and
foules of the aire.</ab>
<ab n="7">And I heard a
voyce, saying vnto me, Arise Peter, slay, and eate.</ab>
<ab n="8">But I said,
Not so, Lord: for nothing common or vncleane hath at any time
entred into my mouth.</ab>
<ab n="9">But the voyce
answered me againe from heauen, What God hath cleansed, that call
not thou common.</ab>
<ab n="10">And this was done
three times: and all were drawen vp againe into heauen.</ab>
<ab n="11">And behold,
immediately there were three men already come vnto the house where
I was, sent from Cesarea vnto me.</ab>
<ab n="12">And the spirit bad
me goe with them, nothing doubting: Moreouer, these sixe brethren
accompanied me, and we entred into the mans house:</ab>
<ab n="13">And he shewed vs
how hee had seene an Angell in his house, which stood and said vnto
him, Send men to Ioppa, and call for Simon, whose sirname is
Peter:</ab>
<ab n="14">Who shall tell thee
words, wherby thou, and all thy house shal be saued.</ab>
<ab n="15">And as I began to
speake, the holy Ghost fell on them, as on vs at the
beginning.<note> Chap.2. 4.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">Then remembred I
the word of the Lord, how that he said, Iohn indeede baptized with
water: but ye shall be baptized with the holy Ghost.<note> Iohn 1. 26.</note></ab>

<fw>Dearth prophecied.</fw>
<ab n="17">Forasmuch then as
God gaue them the like gift as hee did vnto vs, who beleeued on the
Lord Iesus Christ: what was I that I could withstand God?</ab>
<ab n="18">When they heard
these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying,
Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance vnto
life.</ab>
<ab n="19">¶ Now they
which were scattered abroad vpon the persecution that arose about
Steuen, trauailed as farre as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch,
preaching the word to none, but vnto the Iewes onely.<note> Chap.8.1.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">And some of them
were men of Cyprus, and Cyrene, which when they were come to
Antioch, spake vnto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Iesus.</ab>
<ab n="21">And the hand of the
Lord was with them: and a great number beleeued, and turned vnto
the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="22">¶ Then tidings
of these things came vnto the eares of the Church, which was in
Hierusalem: and they sent foorth Barnabas, that hee should goe as
farre as Antioch.</ab>
<ab n="23">Who when hee came,
and had seene the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all,
that with purpose of heart they would cleaue vnto the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="24">For he was a good
man, and full of the holy Ghost, and of faith: and much people was
added vnto the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="25">Then departed
Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seeke Saul.</ab>
<ab n="26">And when he had
found him, he brought him vnto Antioch. And it came to passe, that
a whole yeere they assembled themselues with the Church, and taught
much people, and the disciples were called Christians first in
Antioch.<note> Or, in the Church.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">¶ And in these
dayes, came Prophets from Hierusalem vnto Antioch.</ab>
<ab n="28">And there stood vp
one of them, named Agabus, and signified by the spirit, that there
should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to
passe in the dayes of Claudius Cesar.</ab>
<ab n="29">Then the disciples,
euery man according to his abilitie, determined to send reliefe
vnto the brethren which dwelt in Iudea.</ab>
<ab n="30">Which also they
did, and sent it to the Elders by the hands of Barnabas and
Saul.</ab>
