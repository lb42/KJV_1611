<head>CHAP. I.</head>
<head>1 The Churches loue vnto Christ. 5
Shee confesseth her deformitie, 7 And prayeth to bee directed to
his flocke. 8 Christ directeth her to the shepheards tents. 9 And
shewing his loue to her, 11 Giueth her gracious promises. 12 The
Church and Christ congratulate one another.</head>

<ab n="1">The song
of songs, which is Solomons.</ab>
<ab n="2">Let him
kisse mee with the kisses of his mouth: for thy Loue is better then
wine.<note> Chap.4. 10. , Hebr. thy loues.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">Because of
the sauour of thy good ointments, thy name is as ointment powred
forth, therefore doe the virgins loue thee.</ab>
<ab n="4">Draw me,
we will runne after thee: the king hath brought me into his
chambers: we will be glad and reioyce in thee, we wil remember thy
loue more then wine: the vpright loue thee.<note> Ioh. 6.44. , Or, they loue thee vprightly.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">I am
blacke, but comely, (O ye daughters of Ierusalem) as the tents of
Kedar, as the curtaines of Solomon.</ab>

<fw>Christ, and his Church.</fw>
<ab n="6">Looke not
vpon me because I am blacke, because the Sunne hath looked vpon me:
my mothers children were angry with me, they made me the keeper of
the vineyards, but mine owne vineyard haue I not kept.</ab>
<ab n="7">Tell me,
(O thou whom my soule loueth) where thou feedest, where thou makest
thy flocke to rest at noone: for why should I be as one that
turneth aside by the flockes of thy companions?<note> Or, as one that is vailed.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">¶ If
thou know not (O thou fairest among women) goe thy way forth by the
footsteps of the flocke, and feede thy kiddes beside the shepheards
tents.</ab>
<ab n="9">I haue
compared thee, O my loue, to a company of horses in Pharaohs
chariots.</ab>
<ab n="10">Thy
cheekes are comely with rowes of iewels, thy necke with chaines of
golde.</ab>
<ab n="11">Wee will
make thee borders of golde, with studdes of siluer.</ab>
<ab n="12">¶
While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth foorth
the smell thereof.</ab>
<ab n="13">A bundle
of myrrhe is my welbeloued vnto me; he shall lie all night betwixt
my breasts.</ab>
<ab n="14">My
beloued is vnto me, as a cluster of Camphire in the vineyards of
Engedi.<note> Or, Cypres.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">Behold,
thou art faire, my loue: behold, thou art faire, thou hast doues
eyes.<note> Or, my companion.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">Behold,
thou art faire, my beloued; yea pleasant: also our bedde is
greene.<note> Chap.4.1 and 5.12.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">The
beames of our house are Cedar, and our rafters of
firre.<note> Or, galleries.</note></ab>
