<head>CHAP.
XXI.</head>
<head>1 Ezekiel prophecieth against
Ierusalem, with a signe of sighing. 8 The sharpe and bright sword,
18 against Ierusalem, 25 against the kingdome, 28 and against the
Ammonites.</head>

<ab n="1">And the word of
þ<note/> Lord came vnto me, saying,</ab>
<ab n="2">Sonne of man, set
thy face toward Ierusalem, and drop thy word toward the holy
places, and prophecie against the land of Israel,</ab>
<ab n="3">And say to
þ<note/> land of Israel, Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I
am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath,
and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.</ab>
<ab n="4">Seeing then that
I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore
shall my sword goe forth out of his sheath against all flesh from
the South to the North:</ab>
<ab n="5">That all flesh
may know, that I the Lord haue drawen foorth my sword out of his
sheath: it shall not returne any more.</ab>
<ab n="6">Sigh therefore
thou sonne of man with the breaking of thy loynes, and with
bitternesse sigh before their eyes.</ab>
<ab n="7">And it shall be,
when they say vnto thee; Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt
answere, For the tidings, because it commeth: and euery heart shall
melt, and all hands shalbe feeble, and euery spirit shal faint, and
all knees shal be weake as water: behold, it commeth, and shalbe
brought to passe, sayth the Lord God.<note> Heb. shall goe into water.</note></ab>

<fw>The sword drawen, and
fourbished.</fw>
<ab n="8">¶ Againe,
the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,</ab>
<ab n="9">Sonne of man,
prophecie and say, Thus sayth the Lord, Say, A sword, a sword is
sharpened, and also fourbished.</ab>
<ab n="10">It is sharpened
to make a sore slaughter; it is fourbished, that it may glitter:
should we then make mirth? It contemneth the rod of my sonne, as
euery tree.<note> Or, it is the rod of my sonne, it despiseth euery tree.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And he hath
giuen it to be fourbished, that it may be handled: this sword is
sharpened, and it is fourbished to giue it into the hand of the
slayer.</ab>
<ab n="12">Cry and howle,
sonne of man, for it shalbe vpon my people, it shalbe vpon all the
princes of Israel: terrours, by reason of the sword, shall be vpon
my people: smite therefore vpon thy thigh.<note> Or, they are thrust downe to the sword with my people. , Iere.31.19.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Because it is a
tryall, and what if the sword contemne euen the rodde? it shall be
no more, sayth the Lord God.<note> Or, when the triall hath beene, what then? shall they not also belong to the despising rod?</note></ab>
<ab n="14">Thou therefore
sonne of man, prophecie and smite thine hands together, and let the
sword bee doubled the third time, the sword of the slaine, it is
the sword of the great men, that are slaine, which entreth into
their priuie chambers.<note> Heb. hand to hand.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">I haue set the
point of the sword against all their gates, that their heart may
faint, and their ruines be multiplied. Ah, it is made bright, it is
wrapt vp for the slaughter.<note> Or, glittering, or feare. , Or, sharpened.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">Goe thee one way
or other, either on the right hand, or on the left, whithersoeuer
thy face is set.<note> Heb. set thy selfe, take the left hand.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">I will also
smite mine hands together, and I wil cause my furie to rest: I the
Lord haue sayd it.</ab>
<ab n="18">¶ The word
of the Lord came vnto me againe, saying,</ab>
<ab n="19">Also thou sonne
of man, appoint thee two wayes, that the sword of the king of
Babylon may come: both twaine shall come forth out of one land: and
choose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the
citie.</ab>
<ab n="20">Appoint a way,
that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Iudah
in Ierusalem the defenced.</ab>
<ab n="21">For the king of
Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two
wayes, to vse diuination: he made his arrowes bright, he consulted
with images, he looked in the liuer.<note> Heb. mother of the way. , Or, kniues. , Heb. Teraphim.</note></ab>

<fw>Against Ammon.</fw>
<ab n="22">At his right
hand was the diuination for Ierusalem to appoint captaines, to open
the mouth in the slaughter, to lift vp the voice with shouting, to
appoint battering-rammes against the gates, to cast a mount and to
build a fort.<note> Or, battering rams. , Heb. rams.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">And it shall be
vnto them as a false diuination in their sight, to them that haue
sworne oathes: but he will call to remembrance the iniquitie, that
they may be taken.<note> Or, for the oathes made vnto them.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">Therefore thus
saith the Lord God, Because yee haue made your iniquitie to be
remembred, in that your transgressions are discouered, so that in
all your doings your sinnes doe appeare: because, I say, that yee
are come to remembrance, yee shall be taken with the hand.</ab>
<ab n="25">¶ And thou
prophane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquitie
shall haue an end,</ab>
<ab n="26">Thus saith the
Lord God, Remoue the diademe, and take off the crowne: this shall
not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is
high.</ab>
<ab n="27">I will
ouerturne, ouerturne, ouerturne it, and it shall be no more, vntill
he come, whose right it is, and I wil giue it him.<note> Heb. peruerted, peruerted, peruerted will I make it.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">¶ And thou
sonne of man, prophecie, and say, Thus saith the Lord God
concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproch: Euen say
thou; The sword, the sword is drawen, for the slaughter it is
fourbished, to consume because of the glittering:</ab>
<ab n="29">Whiles they see
vanitie vnto thee, whiles they diuine a lie vnto thee, to bring
thee vpon the necks of them that are slaine, of the wicked whose
day is come, when their iniquitie shall haue an end.</ab>
<ab n="30">Shall I cause it
to returne into his sheath? I will iudge thee in the place where
thou wast created, in the land of thy natiuitie.<note> Or, cause to it to returne.</note></ab>
<ab n="31">And I will powre
out mine indignation vpon thee, I will blow against thee in the
fire of my wrath, and deliuer thee into the hand of brutish men and
skilfull to destroy.<note> Or, burning.</note></ab>
<ab n="32">Thou shalt be
for fuell to the fire: thy blood shall be in the middest of the
land, thou shalt be no more remembred: for I the Lord haue spoken
it.</ab>
