made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly
despised.</ab>

<fw>Edom threatned for crueltie.</fw>
<ab n="3">¶ The pride
of thine heart hath deceiued thee: thou that dwellest in the clefts
of the rocke, Whose habitation is high, that saith in his heart:
Who shall bring me downe to the ground?</ab>
<ab n="4">Though thou exalt
thy selfe as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the
starres, thence will I bring thee downe, saith the
Lord.<note> Ier.49. 16.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">If theeues came to
thee, if robbers by night (how art thou cut off?) would they not

thee, would they not leaue some grapes?<note> Ier.49.9. , Or, gleanings.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">How are the things
of Esau searched out? how are his hid things sought vp?</ab>
<ab n="7">All the men of thy
confederacie haue brought thee euen to the border: the men that

<ab n="11">In the day that
thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers
caried away captiue his forces, and forreiners entred into his
gates, and cast lots vpon Ierusalem, euen thou wast as one of
them.<note> Or, caried away his substance.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">But thou
shouldest not haue looked on the day of thy brother in the day that
hee became a stranger, neither shouldest thou haue reioyced ouer
the children of Iudah in the day of their destruction: neither
shouldest thou haue spoken proudly in the day of
distresse.<note> Or, doe not behold, &amp;c. , Heb. magnified thy mouth.</note></ab>

substance in the day of their calamitie.<note> Or, forces.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">Neither shouldest
thou haue stood in the crosse way to cut off those of his that did

deuoure them, and there shall not be any remaining of the house of
Esau, for the Lord hath spoken it.</ab>

South shall possesse the mount of Esau, and they of the plaine, the
Philistines: and they shall possesse the fields of Ephraim, and the
fields of Samaria, and Beniamin shall possesse Gilead.</ab>
