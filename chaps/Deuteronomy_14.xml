<ab n="7">Neuerthelesse
these yee shall not eate, of them that chew the cud, or of them
that diuide the clouen hoofe, as the camel, and the hare, and the

<ab n="21">¶ Ye
shall not eate of any thing that dieth of it selfe: thou shalt giue
it vnto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eate it, or
thou mayest sell it vnto an alien: for thou art an holy people vnto
the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kidde in his mothers
milke.<note> Exod. 23.19. and 34. 26.</note></ab>

shall chuse to set his name there, when the Lord thy God hath
blessed thee:</ab>
<ab n="25">Then shalt
thou turne it into money, and binde vp the money in thine hand, and
shalt goe vnto the place which the Lord thy God shal chuse.</ab>
<ab n="26">And thou
shalt bestow that money for whatsoeuer thy soule lusteth after, for
oxen, or for sheepe, or for wine, or for strong drinke, or for
whatsoeuer thy soule desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the
Lord thy God, and thou shalt reioyce, thou and thine
houshold.<note> Heb. asketh of thee.</note></ab>

hath no part nor inheritance with thee.<note> Chap.12. 19.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">¶ At
the end of three yeres thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of
thine increase the same yeere, and shalt lay it vp within thy

stranger, and the fatherlesse, and the widowe which are within thy
gates, shall come and shal eate, and be satisfied, that the Lord
thy God may blesse thee, in all the worke of thine hande which thou
doest.</ab>
