<head>CHAP. XV.</head>
<head>1 The strong must beare with the
weake. 2 We may not please our selues, 3 for Christ did not so, 7
but receiue one the other, as Christ did vs all, 8 both Iewes 9 and
Gentiles. 15 Paul excuseth his writing, 28 and promiseth to see
them, 30 and requesteth their prayers.</head>

<ab n="1">Wee then that are
strong, ought to beare the infirmities of the weake, and not to
please our selues.</ab>
<ab n="2">Let euery one of
vs please his neighbour for his good to edification.</ab>
<ab n="3">For euen Christ
pleased not himselfe, but as it is written, The reproches of them
that reproched thee, fell on mee.<note> Psal. 69.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">For whatsoeuer
things were written aforetime, were written for our learning, that
we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might haue
hope.</ab>
<ab n="5">Now the God of
patience and consolation graunt you to be like minded one towards
another, according to Christ Iesus:<note> 1. Cor. 1 10. , Or, after the example of.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">That ye may with
one mind and one mouth glorifie God, euen the Father of our Lord
Iesus Christ.</ab>
<ab n="7">Wherfore receiue
yee one another, as Christ also receiued vs, to the glory of
God.</ab>
<ab n="8">Now I say, that
Iesus Christ was a Minister of the circumcision for the trueth of
God, to confirme the promises made vnto the fathers:</ab>
<ab n="9">And that the
Gentiles might glorifie God for his mercie, as it is written, For
this cause I will confesse to thee among the Gentiles, and sing
vnto thy Name.<note> Psal. 18.50</note></ab>
<ab n="10">And againe he
saith, Reioyce yee Gentiles with his people.<note> Deut. 32. 43.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And againe,
Praise the Lord all ye Gentiles, and laud him all ye
people.<note> Psal. 117.1</note></ab>

<fw>Pauls glory.</fw>
<ab n="12">And againe Esaias
saith, There shal be a roote of Iesse, and he that shal rise to
raigne ouer the Gentiles, in him shall the Gentiles
trust.<note> Es. 11.10.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Nowe the God of
hope fill you with all ioy and peace in beleeuing, that yee may
abound in hope through the power of the holy Ghost.</ab>
<ab n="14">And I my selfe
also am perswaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of
goodnesse, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one
another.</ab>
<ab n="15">Neuerthelesse,
brethren, I haue written the more boldly vnto you, in some sort, as
putting you in mind, because of the grace that is giuen to mee of
God,</ab>
<ab n="16">That I should be
the minister of Iesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministring the Gospel
of God, that the offering vp of the Gentiles might be acceptable,
being sanctified by the holy Ghost.<note> Or, sacrificing.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">I haue therfore
whereof I may glory through Iesus Christ, in those things which
pertaine to God.</ab>
<ab n="18">For I will not
dare to speake of any of those things, which Christ hath not
wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and
deede,</ab>
<ab n="19">Through mighty
signes and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from
Hierusalem and round about vnto Illyricum, I haue fully preached
the Gospel of Christ.</ab>
<ab n="20">Yea, so haue I
striued to preach the Gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I
should build vpon another mans foundation:</ab>
<ab n="21">But as it is
written, To whom hee was not spoken of, they shall see: and they
that haue not heard, shall vnderstand.<note> Esa. 52.15</note></ab>
<ab n="22">For which cause
also I haue been much hindered from coming to you.<note> Or, many wayes, or oftentimes.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">But now hauing no
more place in these parts, and hauing a great desire these many
yeeres to come vnto you:</ab>
<ab n="24">Whensoeuer I take
my iourney into Spaine, I will come to you: for I trust to see you
in my iourney, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if
first I be somewhat filled with your company.<note> Gr. with you, Ver. 32.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">But now I goe
vnto Hierusalem, to minister vnto the Saints.</ab>
<ab n="26">For it hath
pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia, to make a certaine
contribution for the poore Saints which are at Hierusalem.</ab>

<fw>Salutations.</fw>
<ab n="27">It hath pleased
them verely, and their detters they are. For if the Gentiles haue
bene made partakers of their spirituall things, their duetie is
also to minister vnto them in carnall things.</ab>
<ab n="28">When therefore I
haue performed this, and hane sealed to them this fruit, I will
come by you into Spaine.</ab>
<ab n="29">And I am sure
that when I come vnto you, I shall come in the fulnes of the
blessing of Ã¾e Gospel of Christ.</ab>
<ab n="30">Now I beseech
you, brethren, for the Lord Iesus Christs sake, and for the loue of
the Spirit, that ye striue together with me, in your praiers to God
for me,</ab>
<ab n="31">That I may bee
deliuered from them that do not beleeue in Iudea, and that my
seruice which I haue for Hierusalem, may bee accepted of the
Saints:<note> Or, are disobedient.</note></ab>
<ab n="32">That I may come
vnto you with ioy by the will of God, and may with you be
refreshed.</ab>
<ab n="33">Now the God of
peace bee with you all. Amen.</ab>
