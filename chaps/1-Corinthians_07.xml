<head>CHAP.
VII.</head>
<head>2 He treateth of mariage, 4 shewing
it to be a remedy against fornication: 10 And that the bond thereof
ought not lightly to be dissolued. 18. 20 Euery man must be content
with his vocation. 25 Virginitie wherefore to be imbraced. 35 And
for what respects we may either marry, or abstaine from
marying.</head>

<ab n="1">Now
cōcerning the things wherof ye wrote vnto me, It is good for a
man not to touch a woman.</ab>
<ab n="2">Neuerthelesse,
to auoid fornication, let euery man haue his owne wife, and let
euery woman haue her owne husband.</ab>
<ab n="3">Let the
husband render vnto the wife due beneuolence: and likewise also the
wife vnto the husband.</ab>

<fw>Of mariage, and virginity.</fw>
<ab n="4">The wife
hath not power of her owne body, but the husband: and likewise also
the husband hath not power of his owne body, but the wife.</ab>
<ab n="5">Defraud you
not one the other, except it bee with consent for a time, that yee
may giue your selues to fasting and prayer, and come together
againe, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinencie.</ab>
<ab n="6">But I speake
this by permission, and not of commandement.</ab>
<ab n="7">For I would
that all men were euen as I my selfe: but euery man hath his proper
gift of God, one after this maner, and another after that.</ab>
<ab n="8">I say
therefore to the vnmaried and widowes, It is good for them if they
abide euen as I.</ab>
<ab n="9">But if they
cannot conteine, let them marry: for it is better to marrie then to
burne.</ab>
<ab n="10">And vnto
the married, I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife
depart from her husband:</ab>
<ab n="11">But and if
shee depart, let her remaine vnmaried, or be reconciled to her
husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.</ab>
<ab n="12">But to the
rest speake I, not the Lord, If any brother hath a wife that
beleeueth not, and shee bee pleased to dwell with him, let him not
put her away.</ab>
<ab n="13">And the
woman which hath an husband that beleeueth not, and if hee be
pleased to dwell with her, let her not leaue him.</ab>
<ab n="14">For the
vnbeleeuing husband is sanctified by the wife, and the vnbeleeuing
wife is sanctified by the husband; else were your children
vncleane, but now are they holy.</ab>
<ab n="15">But if the
vnbeleeuing depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not
vnder bondage in such cases: but God hath called vs to
peace.<note> Gr. in peace</note></ab>
<ab n="16">For what
knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt saue thy husband? or how
knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt saue thy wife?</ab>
<ab n="17">But as God
hath distributed to euery man, as the Lord hath called euery one,
so let him walke, and so ordeine I in all Churches.</ab>
<ab n="18">Is any man
called being circumcised? let him not become vncircumcised: Is any
called in vncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.</ab>

<fw>Of mariage, and virginity.</fw>
<ab n="19">Circumcision
is nothing, and vncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the
Commandements of God.</ab>
<ab n="20">Let euery
man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.</ab>
<ab n="21">Art thou
called being a seruant? care not for it: but if thou maist be made
free, vse it rather.</ab>
<ab n="22">For he that
is called in the Lord, being a seruant, is the Lords free man:
likewise also hee that is called being free, is Christs
seruant.<note> Gr. made free.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">Ye are
bought with a price, be not ye the seruants of men.</ab>
<ab n="24">Brethren,
let euery man wherin he is called, therein abide with God.</ab>
<ab n="25">Nowe
concerning virgins, I haue no commaundement of the Lord: yet I giue
my iudgement as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be
faithfull.</ab>
<ab n="26">I suppose
therefore that this is good for the present distresse, I say, that
it is good for a man so to be.<note> Or, necessitie.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">Art thou
bound vnto a wife? seeke not to bee loosed. Art thou loosed from a
wife? seeke not a wife.</ab>
<ab n="28">But and if
thou marry, thou hast not sinned, and if a virgin marry, shee hath
not sinned: neuerthelesse, such shall haue trouble in the flesh:
but I spare you.</ab>
<ab n="29">But this I
say, brethren, the time is short. It remaineth, that both they that
haue wiues, be as though they had none:</ab>
<ab n="30">And they
that weepe, as though they wept not: and they that reioyce, as
though they reioyced not: and they that buy, as though they
possessed not:</ab>
<ab n="31">And they
that vse this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this
world passeth away.</ab>
<ab n="32">But I would
haue you without carefulnesse. He that is vnmarried, careth for the
things that belōgeth to the Lord, how he may please the
Lord:</ab>
<ab n="33">But hee
that is maried, careth for the things that are of the world, how he
may please his wife.</ab>
<ab n="34">There is
difference also between a wife and a virgin: the vnmaried woman
careth for the things of the Lord, that shee may be holy, both in
body and in spirit: but she that is married, careth for the things
of the worlde, how shee may please her husband.</ab>

<fw>Of offending our brethren.</fw>
<ab n="35">And this I
speake for your owne profite, not that I may cast a snare vpon you,
but for that which is comely, and that you may attend vpon the Lord
without distraction.</ab>
<ab n="36">But if any
man thinke that he behaueth himselfe vncomely toward his virgin, if
she passe the floure of her age, and neede so require, let him doe
what hee will, hee sinneth not: let them marry.</ab>
<ab n="37">Neuerthelesse,
hee that standeth stedfast in his heart, hauing no necessitie, but
hath power ouer his owne will, and hath so decreed in his heart
that he will keepe his virgin, doeth well.</ab>
<ab n="38">So then he
that giueth her in mariage, doeth wel: but he that giueth her not
in mariage, doeth better.</ab>
<ab n="39">The wife is
bound by the Lawe as long as her husband liueth: but if her husband
bee dead, shee is at liberty to bee maried to whom shee will, onely
in the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="40">But shee is
happier if shee sobide, after my iudgment: and I thinke also that I
haue the Spirit of God.</ab>
