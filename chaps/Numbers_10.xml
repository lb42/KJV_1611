<ab n="2">Make thee two
trumpets of siluer: of an whole piece shalt thou make them, that
thou mayest vse them for the calling of the assembly, and for the
iourneying of the campes.</ab>
<ab n="3">And when they
shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselues to
thee, at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.</ab>
<ab n="4">And if they blow
but with one trumpet, then the Princes, which are heads of the
thousands of Israel, shall gather themselues vnto thee.</ab>
<ab n="5">When ye blow an
alarme, then the campes that lie on the East parts, shall goe
forward.</ab>
<ab n="6">When you blow an
alarme the second time, then the campes that lye on the Southside,
shall take their iourney: they shall blow an alarme for their
iourneys.</ab>
<ab n="7">But when the
Congregation is to be gathered together, you shal blow: but you
shall not sound an alarme.</ab>

warre in your land, against the enemie that oppresseth you, then ye
shall blow an alarme with the trumpets, and ye shalbe remembred
before the Lord your God, and yee shalbe saued from your
enemies.</ab>
<ab n="10">Also in the day
of your gladnesse, and in your solemne dayes, and in the beginnings
of your monethes, ye shall blow with the trumpets ouer your burnt
offerings, and ouer the sacrifices of your peace offerings, that
they may bee to you for a memoriall before your God: I am the Lord
your God.</ab>
