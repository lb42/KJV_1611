<head>CHAP. IV.</head>
<head>1 An Exhortation to obedience. 41
Moses appointeth the three Cities of refuge on that side
Iordan.</head>

<ab n="1">Nowe therefore
hearken, O Israel, vnto the Statutes, and vnto the Iudgments which
I teach you, for to do them, that ye may liue, and goe in and
possesse the lande, which the Lord God of your fathers giueth
you.</ab>
<ab n="2">Ye shall not
adde vnto the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish
ought from it, that ye may keepe the Commaundements of the Lord
your God, which I command you.<note> Chap. 12. 32. iosh. 1.7 pro.30.6. reu.22.18.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">Your eyes haue
seene what the Lord did because of Baal Peor: for all the men that
followed Baal Peor, the Lord thy God hath destroyed them from among
you.<note> Num. 25. 4 &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">But yee that
did cleaue vnto the Lord your God, are aliue euery one of you this
day.</ab>
<ab n="5">Behold, I haue
taught you Statutes, and Iudgements, euen as the Lord my God
commanded me, that ye should do so, in the land whither ye goe to
possesse it.</ab>
<ab n="6">Keepe
therefore, and doe them; for this is your wisedome and your
vnderstanding in the sight of the nations, which shall heare all
these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and
vnderstanding people.</ab>
<ab n="7">For what
nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh vnto them, as the
Lord our God is in all things, that we call vpon him for?</ab>
<ab n="8">And what
nation is there so great, that hath Statutes and Iudgements so
righteous, as all this Law which I set before you this day?</ab>
<ab n="9">Onely take
heed to thy selfe, and keepe thy soule diligently, lest thou forget
the things which thine eyes haue seene, and lest they depart from
thy heart all the dayes of thy life: but teach them thy sonnes,
&amp; thy sonnes sonnes:</ab>

<fw>Exhortations to obedience.</fw>
<ab n="10">Specially,
the day that thou stoodst before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when
the Lord said vnto mee, Gather me the people together, and I will
make them heare my wordes, that they may learne to feare mee all
the dayes that they shall liue vpon the earth, and that they may
teach their children.</ab>
<ab n="11">And ye came
neere and stood vnder the mountaine, and the mountaine burnt with
fire vnto the midst of heauen, with darkenes, cloudes, and thicke
darkenesse.<note> Exod.19. 18. , Heb. heart.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">And the Lord
spake vnto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voyce of
the words, but saw no similitude, onely ye heard a
voyce.<note> Heb saue a voyce.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">And he
declared vnto you his couenant, which he commanded you to performe,
euen ten cōmandements, and he wrote them vpon two tables of
stone.</ab>
<ab n="14">¶ And
the Lord commanded me at that time, to teach you Statutes, and
Iudgements, that yee might doe them in the land whither ye goe ouer
to possesse it.</ab>
<ab n="15">Take ye
therfore good heed vnto your selues, (for ye saw no maner of
similitude on the day that the Lord spake vnto you in Horeb, out of
the midst of the fire)</ab>
<ab n="16">Lest yee
corrupt your selues, and make you a grauen image, the similitude of
any figure, the likenes of male, or female,</ab>
<ab n="17">The likenesse
of any beast that is on the earth, the likenes of any winged foule
that flieth in the aire,</ab>
<ab n="18">The likenesse
of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likenesse of any fish
that is in the waters beneath the earth:</ab>
<ab n="19">And lest thou
lift vp thine eyes vnto heauen, and when thou seest the sun, and
the moone, and the starres, euen all the hoste of heauen, shouldest
be driuen to worship them, and serue them, which the Lord thy God
hath diuided vnto all nations vnder the whole heauen.<note> Or, imparted.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">But the Lord
hath taken you, and brought you foorth out of the yron fornace,
euen out of Egypt, to bee vnto him a people of inheritance, as ye
are this day.</ab>
<ab n="21">Furthermore,
the Lord was angry with mee for your sakes, and sware that I should
not goe ouer Iordan, and that I should not goe in vnto that good
land which the Lord thy God giueth thee for an inheritance.</ab>
<ab n="22">But I must
die in this lande, I must not goe ouer Iordan: but ye shall goe
ouer and possesse that good land.</ab>

<fw>Gods mercie toward Israel.</fw>
<ab n="23">Take heed
vnto your selues, lest ye forget the couenant of the Lord your God,
which hee made with you, and make you a grauen image, or the
likenes of any thing which the Lord thy God hath forbidden
thee.</ab>
<ab n="24">For the Lord
thy God is a consuming fire, euen a iealous God.<note> Chap.9.3. Hebr.12. 19.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">¶ When
thou shalt beget children, and childrens children, and shalt haue
remained long in the land, and shal corrupt your selues, &amp; make
a grauen image, or the likenes of any thing, and shall doe euil in
the sight of the Lord thy God, to prouoke him to anger:</ab>
<ab n="26">I call heauen
and earth to witnesse against you this day, that ye shall soone
vtterly perish from off the land whereunto you goe ouer Iordan, to
possesse it: yee shall not prolong your dayes vpon it, but shall
vtterly bee destroyed.</ab>
<ab n="27">And the Lord
shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in
number among the heathen, whither the Lord shall lead you.</ab>
<ab n="28">And there ye
shall serue gods, the worke of mens hands, wood and stone, which
neither see, nor heare, nor eate, nor smell.</ab>
<ab n="29">But if from
thence thou shalt seeke the Lord thy God, thou shalt finde him, if
thou seeke him with all thy heart, and with all thy soule.</ab>
<ab n="30">When thou art
in tribulation, and all these things are come vpon thee, euen in
the latter dayes, if thou turne to the Lord thy God, and shalt be
obedient vnto his voice:<note> Hebr. haue found thee.</note></ab>
<ab n="31">(For the Lord
thy God is a mercifull God) he will not forsake thee, neither
destroy thee, nor forget the couenant of thy fathers, which he
sware vnto them.</ab>
<ab n="32">For aske now
of the dayes that are past, which were before thee, since the day
that God created man vpon earth, and aske from the one side of
heauen vnto the other, whether there hath bene any such thing as
this great thing is, or hath bene heard like it?</ab>
<ab n="33">Did euer
people heare the voyce of God speaking out of the midst of the
fire, as thou hast heard, and liue?</ab>

<fw>Gods mercie toward Israel.</fw>
<ab n="34">Or hath God
assayed to goe and take him a nation from the midst of another
nation, by temptations, by signes, and by wonders, and by warre,
and by a mighty hand, and by a stretehed out arme, and by great
terrors, according to all that the Lord your God did for you in
Egypt before your eyes?</ab>
<ab n="35">Unto thee it
was shewed, that thou mightest know, that the Lord hee is God;
there is none else besides him.</ab>
<ab n="36">Out of heauen
hee made thee to heare his voice, that he might instruct thee: and
vpon earth hee shewed thee his great fire, and thou heardest his
words out of the midst of the fire.</ab>
<ab n="37">And because
he loued thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and
brought thee out in his sight with his mightie power out of
Egypt:</ab>
<ab n="38">To driue out
nations from before thee, greater and mightier then thou art, to
bring thee in, to giue thee their land for an inheritance, as it is
this day.</ab>
<ab n="39">Know
therefore this day, &amp; consider it in thine heart, that the Lord
hee is God in heauen aboue, and vpon the earth beneath: there is
none else.</ab>
<ab n="40">Thou shalt
keepe therefore his Statutes, and his Commandements, which I
command thee this day; that it may goe well with thee, and with thy
children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy dayes vpon
the earth, which the Lord thy God giueth thee, for euer.</ab>
<ab n="41">¶ Then
Moses seuered three cities on this side Iordan, toward the Sunne
rising:</ab>
<ab n="42">That the
slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour
vnawares, and hated him not in times past, and that fleeing vnto
one of these cities he might liue:</ab>
<ab n="43">Namely, Bezer
in the wildernesse, in the plaine countrey of the Reubenites; and
Ramoth in Gilead of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the
Manassites.<note> Iosh. 20. 8.</note></ab>
<ab n="44">¶ And
this is the Law which Moses set before the children of
Israel:</ab>
<ab n="45">These are the
Testimonies, and the Statutes, and the Iudgements, which Moses
spake vnto the children of Israel, after they came foorth out of
Egypt;</ab>
<ab n="46">On this side
Iordan in the valley ouer against Beth-Peor, in the land of Sihon
King of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the
children of Israel smote, after they were come foorth out of
Egypt.<note> Num.21. 24. chap. 1. 4.</note></ab>

<fw>The Law is repeated.</fw>
<ab n="47">And they
possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of
the Amorites, which were on this side Iordan toward the sun
rising,<note> Num.21. 33. chap.3. 3.</note></ab>
<ab n="48">From Aroer,
which is by the banke of the riuer Arnon, euen vnto mount Sion,
which is Hermon,</ab>
<ab n="49">And all the
plaine of this side Iordan Eastward, euen vnto the sea, of the
plaine vnder the springs of Pisgah.<note> Chap.3. 17.</note></ab>
