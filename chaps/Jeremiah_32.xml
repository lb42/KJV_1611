<head>CHAP.
XXXII.</head>
<head>1 Ieremiah being imprisoned by
Zedekiah for his prophecie, 6 buyeth Hanameels field. 13 Baruch
must preserue the euidences, as tokens of the peoples returne. 16
Ieremiah in his prayer complaineth to God. 26 God confirmeth the
captiuitie for their sinnes, 36 and promiseth a gracious
returne.</head>

<ab n="1">The worde that
came to Ieremiah from the Lord in the tenth yeere of Zedekiah king
of Iudah, which was the eighteenth yeere of
Nebuchad-rezzar.</ab>
<ab n="2">For then the
king of Babylons armie besieged Ierusalem: and Ieremiah the prophet
was shut vp in the court of the prison which was in the king of
Iudahs house.</ab>
<ab n="3">For Zedekiah
king of Iudah had shut him vp, saying, Wherefore doest thou
prophecie and say, Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will giue this
citie into the hand of the king of Babylon, and hee shall take
it?<note> Cha. 34.2</note></ab>

<fw>Ieremiahs purchase.</fw>
<ab n="4">And Zedekiah
king of Iudah, shal not escape out of the hand of the Caldeans, but
shall surely be deliuered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and
shal speake with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his
eyes.<note> Chap.34.3.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">And he shall
lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be vntill I visit him,
saith the Lord: though ye fight with the Caldeans, yee shall not
prosper.</ab>
<ab n="6">¶ And
Ieremiah said; The word of the Lord came vnto me, saying;</ab>
<ab n="7">Behold, Hanameel
the sonne of Shallum thine vncle, shall come vnto thee, saying; Buy
thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is
thine to buy it.<note> Leuit. 25. 24. ruth.4. 4.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">So Hanameel mine
vncles sonne came to me in the court of the prison, according to
the word of the Lord, and said vnto me; Buy my field, I pray thee,
that is in Anathoth, which is in the countrey of Beniamin: for the
right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine, buy it
for thy selfe. Then I knew that this was the word of the
Lord.</ab>
<ab n="9">And I bought the
field of Hanameel my vncles sonne, that was in Anathoth, and
weighed him the money, euen seuenteene shekels of
siluer.<note> Or, seuen shekels and ten pieces of siluer.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">And I
subscribed the euidence, and sealed it, and tooke witnesses, and
weighed him the money in the ballances.<note> Heb. wrote in the booke.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">So I tooke the
euidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to
the law and custome, and that which was open.</ab>
<ab n="12">And I gaue the
euidence of the purchase vnto Baruch the sonne of Neriah, the sonne
of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine vncles sonne, and in the
presence of the witnesses, that subscribed the booke of the
purchase, before all the Iewes that sate in the court of the
prison.</ab>
<ab n="13">¶ And I
charged Baruch before them, saying,</ab>
<ab n="14">Thus saith the
Lord of hosts the God of Israel; Take these euidences, this
euidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this euidence
which is open, and put them in an earthen vessell, that they may
continue many daies.</ab>

<fw>His prayer.</fw>
<ab n="15">For thus saith
the Lord of hostes the God of Israel; Houses and fields, and
Uineyards shalbe possessed againe in this land.</ab>
<ab n="16">¶ Now when
I had deliuered the euidence of the purchase vnto Baruch the sonne
of Neriah, I prayed vnto the Lord, saying,</ab>
<ab n="17">Ah Lord God,
beholde, thou hast made the heauen and the earth by thy great power
&amp; stretched out arme, and there is nothing too hard for
thee.<note> Or, hid from thee.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Thou shewest
louing kindnesse vnto thousands, and recompensest the iniquitie of
the fathers into the bosome of their children after them: the
great, the mightie God, the Lord of hosts is his Name,<note> Exod.34.7. deut,5.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">Great in
counsell, and mightie in worke, (for thine eyes are open vpon all
the wayes of the sonnes of men, to giue euery one according to his
wayes, and according to the fruit of his doings)<note> Heb. doing. , Iob 34. 21. pro.5. 21. chap. 16.17.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">Which hast set
signes and wonders in the land of Egypt, euen vnto this day, and in
Israel, and amongst other men, and hast made thee a Name, as at
this day,</ab>
<ab n="21">And hast
brought foorth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt, with
signes and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a
stretched out arme, and with great terrour,<note> Exod.6.6. 2.sam.7.23. 1. chro.17. 21.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">And hast giuen
them this land which thou didst sweare to their fathers to giue
them a land flowing with milke and honie.</ab>
<ab n="23">And they came
in and possessed it, but they obeied not thy voice, neither walked
in thy Law, they haue done nothing of all that thou commaundedst
them to doe: therefore thou hast caused all this euill to come vpon
them.</ab>
<ab n="24">Beholde the
mounts, they are come vnto the citie to take it, and the citie is
giuen into the hand of the Caldeans that fight against it, because
of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence, and what
thou hast spoken is come to passe, and behold, thou seest
it.<note> Or, engines of shot.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">And thou hast
said vnto mee, O Lord God, buy thee the field for money, and take
witnesses: for the citie is giuen into the hand of the
Caldeans.</ab>
<ab n="26">¶ Then
came the word of the Lord vnto Ieremiah, saying,</ab>
<ab n="27">Behold, I am
the Lord, the God of all flesh: Is there any thing too hard for
me?<note> Num. 16. 22.</note></ab>

<fw>Israels idolatrie.</fw>
<ab n="28">Therfore thus
saith the Lord, Behold, I will giue this citie into the hand of the
Caldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchad-rezzar king of Babylon, and
he shall take it.</ab>
<ab n="29">And the
Caldeans that fight against this citie, shall come and set fire on
this citie, and burne it with the houses vpon whose roofes they
haue offered incense vnto Baal, and powred out drinke offerings
vnto other Gods to prouoke me to anger.<note> Chap. 19. 13.</note></ab>
<ab n="30">For the
children of Israel, and the children of Iudah, haue onely done
euill before me from their youth: for the children of Israel haue
onely prouoked mee to anger with the worke of their hands, sayth
the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="31">For this citie
hath beene to me, as a prouocation of mine anger, and of my furie,
from the day that they built it, euen vnto this day; that I should
remooue it from before my face:<note> Heb. for my anger.</note></ab>
<ab n="32">Because of all
the euill of the children of Israel, and of the children of Iudah,
which they haue done to prouoke mee to anger, they, their kings,
their Princes, their Priestes, and their Prophets, and the men of
Iudah, and the inhabitants of Ierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="33">And they haue
turned vnto mee the backe, and not the face, though I taught them
rising vp early, and teaching them, yet they haue not hearkened to
receiue instruction,<note> Heb. necke. , Cha.2.27.</note></ab>
<ab n="34">But they set
their abominations in the house (which is called by my Name) to
defile it.<note> Chap.23. 11.</note></ab>
<ab n="35">And they built
the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the sonne of
Hinnom, to cause their sonnes and their daughters to passe through
the fire vnto Molech, which I commanded them not, neither came it
into my minde, that they should doe this abomination, to cause
Iudah to sinne.<note> Cha.7.31. and 19.6. , Leuit. 18. 21.</note></ab>
<ab n="36">¶ And now
therefore, thus sayth the Lord the God of Israel concerning this
citie, whereof ye say, It shall be deliuered into the hand of the
king of Babylon, by the sword, and by the famine, and by the
pestilence:</ab>
<ab n="37">Behold, I wil
gather them out of all countreys, whither I haue driuen them in
mine anger, and in my furie, and in great wrath, and I will bring
them againe vnto this place; and I will cause them to dwell
safely.<note> Deu.30.3.</note></ab>
<ab n="38">And they shalbe
my people, and I will be their God.<note> Cha.24.7. and 30.22. and 31.33.</note></ab>

<fw>Gods mercy.</fw>
<ab n="39">And I will giue
them one heart, and one way, that they may feare mee for euer, for
the good of them, and of their children after them.<note> Ezek.11. 19. , Heb. all dayes.</note></ab>
<ab n="40">And I will make
an euerlasting couenant with them, that I will not turne away from
them, to doe them good, but I will put my feare in their hearts,
that they shall not depart from mee.<note> Heb from after them.</note></ab>
<ab n="41">Yea, I will
reioyce oner them to doe them good, and I will plant them in this
land assuredly, with my whole heart, and with my whole
soule.<note> Heb. in trueth, or stabilitie.</note></ab>
<ab n="42">For thus sayth
the Lord, Like as I haue brought all this great euill vpon this
people, so will I bring vpon them all the good that I haue promised
them.</ab>
<ab n="43">And fields
shalbe bought in this land whereof ye say, It is desolate without
man or beast, it is giuen into the hand of the Caldeans.</ab>
<ab n="44">Men shall buy
fields for money, and subscribe euidences, and seale them, and take
witnesses in the land of Beniamin, and in the places about
Ierusalem, and in the cities of Iudah, and in the cities of the
mountaines, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of
the South: for I will cause their captiuitie to returne, saith the
Lord.</ab>
