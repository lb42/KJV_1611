<head>CHAP. IX.</head>
<head>1 Saul despairing to finde his
fathers asses, 6 by the counsell of his seruaunt, 11 and direction
of young maidens, 15 according to Gods reuelation, 18 commeth to
Samuel. 19 Samuel entertaineth Saul at the feast. 25 Samuel after
secret communication, bringeth Saul on his way.</head>

<ab n="1">Now there was a
man of Beniamin, whose name was Kish, the sonne of Abiel, the sonne
of Zeror, the sonne of Bechorath, the sonne of Aphiah, a Beniamite,
a mighty man of power.<note> Chap.14. 51. 1.chro. 8.33. , Or, the sonne of a man of Iemini. , Or, substance.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And he had a
sonne, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and
there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person then
hee: from his shoulders and vpward, hee was higher then any of the
people.</ab>
<ab n="3">And the asses of
Kish, Sauls father, were lost; and Kish said to Saul his sonne,
Take nowe one of the seruants with thee, and arise, goe seeke the
asses.</ab>
<ab n="4">And he passed
thorow mount Ephraim, and passed thorow the land of Shalisha, but
they found them not: then they passed thorow the land of Shalim,
and there they were not: and hee passed thorow the land of the
Beniamites, but they found them not.</ab>
<ab n="5">And when they
were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his seruant that was
with him, Come, and let vs returne, lest my father leaue caring for
the asses, and take thought for vs.</ab>
<ab n="6">And hee said vnto
him, Behold now, there is in this citie a man of God, and he is an
honourable man; all that he saith, commeth surely to passe: Now let
vs goe thither; peraduenture he can shew vs our way that we should
goe.</ab>

<fw>Saul seeking asses, is by Samuel anointed
king.</fw>
<ab n="7">Then said Saul to
his seruaunt, But behold, if we goe, what shall wee bring the man?
for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present
to bring to the man of God: What haue wee?<note> Hebr is gone out of &amp;c. , Hebr. is with vs?</note></ab>
<ab n="8">And the seruant
answered Saul againe, and said, Behold, I haue here at hand the
fourth part of a shekel of siluer; that wil I giue to the man of
God, to tell vs our way.<note> Hebr. there is found in my hand.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">(Beforetime in
Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake; Come, and
let vs go to the Seer: for he that is now called a Prophet, was
beforetime called a Seer.)</ab>
<ab n="10">Then said Saul
to his seruant, Wel said, come, let vs go: so they went vnto the
city where the man of God was.<note> Hebr. thy word is good.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">¶ And as
they went vp the hill to the city, they found yong maydens going
out to draw water, and said vnto them, Is the Seer
here?<note> Hebr. in the ascent of the citie.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">And they
answered them, and said, He is: behold, he is before you, make
haste now: for he came to day to the citie; for there is a
sacrifice of the people to day in the hie place.<note> Or, feast.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Assoone as ye be
come into the citie, ye shall straightway finde him, before he goe
vp to the high place to eate: for the people will not eate vntill
hee come, because he doth blesse the sacrifice, and afterwards they
eat that be bidden: Now therefore get you vp, for about this time
ye shall finde him.<note> Heb. to day.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And they went vp
into the citie: and when they were come into the citie, behold,
Samuel came out against them, for to goe vp to the hie
place.</ab>
<ab n="15">¶ Now the
Lord had told Samuel in his eare a day before Saul came,
saying,<note> Chap. 15. 1. acts. 13. 21. , Heb. reveiled the eare of Samuel.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">To morrow about
this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Beniamin, and
thou shalt anoynt him to be Captaine ouer my people Israel, that he
may saue my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I haue
looked vpon my people, because their cry is come vnto me.</ab>
<ab n="17">And when Samuel
saw Saul, the Lord said vnto him, Behold the man whom I spake to
thee of: this same shall reigne ouer my people.<note> Hebr. restraine in.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Then Saul drew
neere to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where
the Seers house is.</ab>

<fw>Saul seeking asses, is by Samuel anointed
king.</fw>
<ab n="19">And Samuel
answered Saul, and said, I am the Seer: Goe vp before me vnto the
high place, for ye shall eate with me to day, and to morrow I will
let thee goe, and will tell thee all that is in thine
heart.</ab>
<ab n="20">And as for thine
asses that were lost three dayes agoe, set not thy minde on them,
for they are found: And on whom is all the desire of Israel? is it
not on thee, &amp; on all thy fathers house?<note> Hebr. to day three dayes.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">And Saul
answered, and said, Am not I a Beniamite, of the smallest of the
tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of
the tribe of Beniamin? Wherefore then speakest thou so to
me?<note> Hebr. according to this word ?</note></ab>
<ab n="22">And Samuel tooke
Saul, and his seruant, and brought them into the parlour, &amp;
made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden,
which were about thirtie persons.</ab>
<ab n="23">And Samuel said
vnto the cooke, Bring the portion which I gaue thee, of which I
said vnto thee, Set it by thee.</ab>
<ab n="24">And the cooke
took vp the shoulder, and that which was vpon it, and set it before
Saul, and Samuel said, Behold, that which is left, set it before
thee, and eate: for vnto this time hath it bene kept for thee,
since I said I haue inuited the people: So Saul did eat with Samuel
that day.<note> Or, reserued.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">¶ And when
they were come downe from the high place into the citie, Samuel
communed with Saul vpon the top of the house.</ab>
<ab n="26">And they arose
early: and it came to passe about the spring of the day, that
Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may
send thee away: And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, hee
and Samuel, abroad.</ab>
<ab n="27">And as they were
going downe to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the
seruant passe on before vs, (and he passed on) but stand thou still
a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.<note> Hebr. to day.</note></ab>
