<ab n="1">Forasmuch as
many haue taken in hande to set foorth in order a declaration of
those things which are most surely beleeued among vs,</ab>
<ab n="2">Euen as they
deliuered them vnto vs, which from the beginning were
eye-witnesses, &amp; ministers of the word:</ab>
<ab n="3">It seemed good
to me also, hauing had perfect vnderstanding of things from the
very first, to write vnto thee in order, most excellent
Theophilus,</ab>
<ab n="4">That thou
mightest know the certainetie of those things wherein thou hast
bene instructed.</ab>
<ab n="5">Â¶ There
was in the dayes of Herode the king of Iudea, a certaine Priest,
named Zacharias, of the course of Abia, and his wife was of the
daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</ab>
<ab n="6">And they were
both righteous before God, walking in all the Commandements and
ordinances of the Lord, blamelesse.</ab>
<ab n="7">And they had no
childe, because that Elizabeth was barren, and they both were now
well striken in yeeres.</ab>
<ab n="8">And it came to
passe, that while he executed the Priests office before God in the
order of his course,</ab>
<ab n="9">According to
the custome of the Priests office, his lot was to burne incense
when he went into the Temple of the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="10">And the whole
multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of
incense.<note> Exo.30.7. leuit.16.17</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And there
appeared vnto him an Angel of the Lord, standing on the right side
of the Altar of incense.</ab>
<ab n="12">And when
Zacharias sawe him, hee was troubled, and feare fell vpon
him.</ab>
<ab n="13">But the Angel
said vnto him, Feare not, Zacharias, for thy prayer is heard, and
thy wife Elizabeth shall beare thee a sonne, and thou shalt call
his name Iohn.</ab>
<ab n="14">And thou shalt
haue ioy and gladnesse, and many shall reioyce at his
birth:</ab>
<ab n="15">For he shall
be great in the sight of the Lord, and shal drinke neither wine,
nor strong drinke, and he shall bee filled with the holy Ghost,
euen from his mothers wombe.</ab>
<ab n="16">And many of
the children of Israel shall hee turne to the Lord their
God.<note> Malac.4.6</note></ab>

<fw>An Angel is sent to the virgin
Mary.</fw>
<ab n="17">And hee shall
goe before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turne the
hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the
wisedome of the iust, to make ready a people prepared for the
Lord.<note> Or, by.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">And Zacharias
said vnto the Angel, Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old
man, and my wife well striken in yeeres.</ab>
<ab n="19">And the Angel
answering, said vnto him, I am Gabriel that stand in the presence
of God, and am sent to speake vnto thee, and to shew thee these
glad tidings.</ab>
<ab n="20">And behold,
thou shalt be dumbe, and not able to speake, vntill the day that
these things shall bee performed, because thou beleeuest not my
words, which shall bee fulfilled in their season.</ab>
<ab n="21">And the people
waited for Zacharias, and maruelled that hee taried so long in the
temple.</ab>
<ab n="22">And when he
came out, he could not speake vnto them: and they perceiued that he
had seene a vision in the temple: for he beckened vnto them, and
remained speechlesse.</ab>
<ab n="23">And it came to
passe, that as soone as the dayes of his ministration were
accomplished, he departed to his owne house.</ab>
<ab n="24">And after
those dayes his wife Elizabeth conceiued, and hid her selfe fiue
moneths, saying,</ab>
<ab n="25">Thus hath the
Lord dealt with me in the dayes wherein he looked on me, to take
away my reproch among men.</ab>
<ab n="26">And in the
sixt moneth, the Angel Gabriel was sent from God, vnto a citie of
Galilee, named Nazareth,</ab>
<ab n="27">To a virgine
espoused to a man whose name was Ioseph, of the house of Dauid, and
the virgins name was Marie.</ab>
<ab n="28">And the Angel
came in vnto her, and said, Haile thou that art highly fauoured,
the Lord is with thee: Blessed art thou among women.<note> Or, graciously accepted, or much graced, see verse 30.</note></ab>
<ab n="29">And when she
saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her minde what
maner of salutation this should be.</ab>
<ab n="30">And the Angel
said vnto her, Feare not, Marie, for thou hast found fauour with
God.</ab>

<fw>An Angel is sent to the virgin
Mary.</fw>
<ab n="31">And behold,
thou shalt conceiue in thy wombe, and bring forth a sonne, and
shalt call his name Iesus.<note> Esai.7. 14 mat. 1. 21.</note></ab>
<ab n="32">He shall be
great, and shall be called the sonne of the Highest, and the Lord
God shall giue vnto him the throne of his father Dauid.</ab>
<ab n="33">And hee shall
reigne ouer the house of Iacob for euer, and of his kingdome there
shall be no end.<note> Dan.7.14. mich.4.7.</note></ab>
<ab n="34">Then said
Marie vnto the Angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a
man?</ab>
<ab n="35">And the Angel
answered and said vnto her, The holy Ghost shall come vpon thee,
and the power of the Highest shall ouershadow thee. Therefore also
that holy thing which shall bee borne of thee, shall bee called the
sonne of God.</ab>
<ab n="36">And behold,
thy cousin Elizabeth, she hath also conceiued a sonne in her old
age, and this is the sixt moneth with her, who was called
barren.</ab>
<ab n="37">For with God
no thing shall be vnpossible.</ab>
<ab n="38">And Marie
said, Behold the handmaide of the Lord, be it vnto me according to
thy word: and the Angel departed from her.</ab>
<ab n="39">And Marie
arose in those dayes, and went into the hill countrey with haste,
into a citie of Iuda,</ab>
<ab n="40">And entred
into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elizabeth.</ab>
<ab n="41">And it came to
passe that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Marie, the babe
leaped in her wombe, and Elizabeth was filled with the holy
Ghost.</ab>
<ab n="42">And she spake
out with a loud voyce, and saide, Blessed art thou among women, and
blessed is the fruite of thy wombe.</ab>
<ab n="43">And whence is
this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to mee?</ab>
<ab n="44">For loe,
assoone as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine eares, the
babe leaped in my wombe for ioy.</ab>
<ab n="45">And blessed is
she that beleeued, for there shalbe a performance of those things,
which were told her from the Lord.<note> Or, which beleeued, that there.</note></ab>
<ab n="46">And Marie
said, My soule doth magnifie the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="47">And my spirit
hath reioyced in God my sauiour.</ab>

<fw>Maries song.</fw>
<ab n="48">For hee hath
regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for behold, from
hencefoorth all generations shall call me blessed.</ab>
<ab n="49">For he that is
mighty hath done to mee great things, and holy is his Name.</ab>
<ab n="50">And his mercy
is on them that feare him, from generation to generation.</ab>
<ab n="51">Hee hath
shewed strength with his arme, he hath scattered the proud, in the
imagination of their hearts.<note> Esay 51.9. , Psal. 33. 10.</note></ab>
<ab n="52">He hath put
downe the mighty from their seates, and exalted them of low
degree.<note> 1.Sam. 2. 6.</note></ab>
<ab n="53">Hee hath
filled the hungry with good things, and the rich hee hath sent
emptie away.<note> Psal. 34. 10.</note></ab>
<ab n="54">Hee hath
holpen his seruant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy,<note> Iere. 31. 3. 20.</note></ab>
<ab n="55">As he spake to
our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for euer.<note> Psal.132. 10. gen. 17 19.</note></ab>
<ab n="56">And Mary abode
with her about three moneths, and returned to her owne
house.</ab>
<ab n="57">Now Elizabeths
full time came, that shee should be deliuered, and shee brought
foorth a sonne.</ab>
<ab n="58">And her
neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great
mercy vpon her, and they reioyced with her.</ab>
<ab n="59">And it came to
passe that on the eight day they came to circumcise the childe, and
they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.</ab>
<ab n="60">And his mother
answered, and said, Not so, but he shalbe called Iohn.</ab>
<ab n="61">And they said
vnto her, There is none of thy kinred that is called by this
name.</ab>
<ab n="62">And they made
signes to his father, how he would haue him called.</ab>
<ab n="63">And he asked
for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is Iohn: and they
marueiled all.</ab>
<ab n="64">And his mouth
was opened immediatly, and his tongue loosed, and hee spake, and
praised God.</ab>
<ab n="65">And feare came
on all that dwelt round about them, and all these sayings were
noised abroad thorowout all the hill countrey of Iudea.<note> Or, things.</note></ab>
<ab n="66">And all they
that had heard them, layde them vp in their hearts, saying, What
maner of childe shal this be? And the hand of the Lord was with
him.</ab>
<ab n="67">And his father
Zacharias was filled with the holy Ghost, and prophesied,
saying,</ab>

<fw>Zacharias song.</fw>
<ab n="68">Blessed bee
the Lord God of Israel, for hee hath visited and redeemed his
people,</ab>
<ab n="69">And hath
raised vp an horne of saluation for vs, in the house of his seruant
Dauid,<note> Psal.132. 18.</note></ab>
<ab n="70">As he spake by
the mouth of his holy Prophets, which haue bene since the world
began:<note> Iere.23 5 and 30.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="71">That wee
should be saued from our enemies, and from the hand of all that
hate vs,</ab>
<ab n="72">To performe
the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy
Couenant,</ab>
<ab n="73">The oath which
he sware to our father Abraham,<note> Gene. 22. 16.</note></ab>
<ab n="74">That hee would
grant vnto vs, that wee beeing deliuered out of the hands of our
enemies, might serue him without feare,</ab>
<ab n="75">In holinesse
and righteousnesse before him, all the dayes of our life.</ab>
<ab n="76">And thou
childe shalt bee called the Prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt
goe before the face of the Lord to prepare his wayes.</ab>
<ab n="77">To giue
knowledge of saluation vnto his people, by the remission of their
sinnes,<note> Or, for.</note></ab>
<ab n="78">Through the
tender mercy of our God, whereby the day-spring from on high hath
visited vs,<note> Or, bowels of the mercy. , Or, Sunne-rising, or branch, Zac. 3.8. esay 11. 1. malach.4. 2. numb.24. 17.</note></ab>
<ab n="79">To giue light
to them that sit in darknes, and in the shadow of death, to guide
our feet into the way of peace.</ab>
<ab n="80">And the childe
grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts, till the
day of his shewing vnto Israel.</ab>
