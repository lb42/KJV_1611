<head>CHAP.
XIV.</head>
<head>2 Christ healeth the dropsie on the
Sabbath: 7 teacheth humilitie: 12 to feast the poore: 15 Vnder the
parable of the great supper, sheweth how worldly minded men, who
contemne the word of God, shalbe shut out of heauen. 25 Those who
wil be his disciples, to beare their crosse must make their
accounts aforehand, lest with shame they reuolt from him afterward,
34 and become altogether vnprofitable, like salt that hath lost his
sauour.</head>

<ab n="1">And it came to
passe, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharises to
eat bread on þ<note/> Sabbath day, that they watched
him.</ab>
<ab n="2">And behold,
there was a certaine man before him, which had the dropsie.</ab>
<ab n="3">And Iesus
answering, spake vnto the Lawyers and Pharises, saying, Is it
lawfull to heale on the Sabbath day?</ab>
<ab n="4">And they held
their peace. And he tooke him, and healed him, &amp; let him
go,</ab>
<ab n="5">And answered
them, saying, Which of you shall haue an asse or an oxe fallen into
a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the Sabbath
day?</ab>
<ab n="6">And they could
not answere him againe to these things.</ab>

<fw>The great supper.</fw>
<ab n="7">¶ And he
put foorth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked
howe they chose out the chiefe roumes, saying vnto them,</ab>
<ab n="8">When thou art
bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not downe in the highest roume:
lest a more honourable man then thou be bidden of him,</ab>
<ab n="9">And hee that
bade thee and him, come, and say to thee, Giue this man place: and
thou begin with shame to take the lowest roume.</ab>
<ab n="10">But when thou art
bidden, goe and sit downe in the lowest roume, that when he that
bade thee commeth, hee may say vnto thee, Friend, goe vp higher:
then shalt thou haue worship in the presence of them that sit at
meate with thee.<note> Prou. 25. 5</note></ab>
<ab n="11">For whosoeuer
exalteth himselfe, shalbe abased: and hee that humbleth himselfe,
shalbe exalted.<note> Mat. 23. 12.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">¶ Then said
hee also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a
supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy
kinsemen, nor thy rich neighbours, lest they also bid thee againe,
and a recompence be made thee.</ab>
<ab n="13">But when thou
makest a feast, call the poore, the maimed, the lame, the
blinde,<note> Tob.4 7.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And thou shalt be
blessed, for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be
recompensed at the resurrection of the iust.</ab>
<ab n="15">¶ And when one
of them that sate at meate with him, heard these things, he said
vnto him, Blessed is hee that shall eate bread in the kingdom of
God.<note> Reu. 19.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">Then said hee vnto
him, A certaine man made a great supper, and bade many:<note> Mat. 22.2.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">And sent his
seruant at supper time, to say to them that were bidden, Come, for
all things are now ready.</ab>
<ab n="18">And they all with
one consent began to make excuse: The first said vnto him, I haue
bought a piece of ground, and I must needs goe and see it: I pray
thee haue me excused.</ab>
<ab n="19">And another said, I
haue bought fiue yoke of oxen, and I goe to prooue them: I pray
thee haue me excused.</ab>
<ab n="20">And another said, I
haue maried a wife: and therefore I cannot come.</ab>

<fw>Vnsauorie salt.</fw>
<ab n="21">So that seruant
came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the
house being angry, sayde to his seruant, Goe out quickely into the
streetes and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poore, and
the maimed, and the halt, and the blinde.</ab>
<ab n="22">And the seruant
said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is
roume.</ab>
<ab n="23">And the Lord said
vnto the seruant, Goe out into the high wayes and hedges, and
compell them to come in, that my house may be filled.</ab>
<ab n="24">For I say vnto you,
that none of those men which were bidden, shall taste of my
supper.</ab>
<ab n="25">¶ And there
went great multitudes with him: and hee turned, and said vnto
them,</ab>
<ab n="26">If any man come to
me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children,
and brethren, and sisters, yea and his owne life also, hee cannot
be my disciple.<note> Matth. 10. 37.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">And whosoeuer doeth
not beare his crosse, and come after me, cannot be my
disciple.</ab>
<ab n="28">For which of you
intending to build a towre, sitteth not downe first, and counteth
the cost, whether he haue sufficient to finish it?</ab>
<ab n="29">Lest haply after
hee hath laide the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all
that behold it, begin to mock him,</ab>
<ab n="30">Saying, This man
beganne to build, and was not able to finish.</ab>
<ab n="31">Or what king going
to make war against another king, sitteth not downe first, and
consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand, to meete him that
commeth against him with twentie thousand?</ab>
<ab n="32">Or else, while the
other is yet a great way off, hee sendeth an ambassage, and
desireth conditions of peace.</ab>
<ab n="33">So likewise,
whosoeuer he be of you, that forsaketh not all that he hath, he
cannot be my disciple.</ab>
<ab n="34">¶ Salt is
good: but if the salt haue lost his sauour, wherewith shall it be
seasoned?<note> Mat. 5. 13.</note></ab>
<ab n="35">It is neither fit
for the land, nor yet for the dunghill: but men cast it out. He
that hath eares to heare, let him heare.</ab>
