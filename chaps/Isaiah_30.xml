<head>CHAP.
XXX.</head>
<head>1 The Prophet threatneth the people,
for their confidence in Egypt, 8 and contempt of Gods word. 18 Gods
mercies towards his Church. 27 Gods wrath, and the peoples ioy in
the destruction of Assyria.</head>

<ab n="1">Woe to the
rebellious children, sayth the Lord, that take counsell, but not of
mee; and that couer with a couering, but not of my Spirit, that
they may adde sinne to sinne:</ab>
<ab n="2">That walke to goe
downe into Egypt, (and haue not asked at my mouth) to strengthen
themselues in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow
of Egypt.</ab>
<ab n="3">Therefore shall
the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow
of Egypt, your confusion.</ab>
<ab n="4">For his princes
were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.</ab>
<ab n="5">They were all
ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an helpe nor
profite, but a shame and also a reproch.</ab>
<ab n="6">The burden of the
beastes of the South: into the lande of trouble and anguish, from
whence come the yong and old lyon, the viper, and fierie flying
serpent, they will carie their riches vpon the shoulders of yong
asses, and their treasures vpon the bunches of camels, to a people
that shall not profite them.</ab>
<ab n="7">For the Egyptians
shall helpe in vaine, and to no purpose: Therefore haue I cried
concerning this: Their strength is to sit still.<note> Or, to her.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">¶ Now goe,
write it before them in a table, and note it in a booke, that it
may bee for the time to come for euer and euer:<note> Heb. the latter day.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">That this is a
rebellious people, lying children, children that will not heare the
Law of the Lord:</ab>

<fw>Prophesie not.</fw>
<ab n="10">Which say to the
seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophecie not vnto vs right
things: speake vnto vs smooth things, prophecie deceits.</ab>
<ab n="11">Get ye out of the
way: turne aside out of the path: cause the Holy one of Israel to
cease from before vs.</ab>
<ab n="12">Wherefore, thus
saith the Holy one of Israel: Because ye despise this word, and
trust in oppression and peruersnesse, and stay thereon:<note> Or, fraud.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Therefore this
iniquitie shalbe to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in
a high wall, whose breaking commeth suddenly at an instant.</ab>
<ab n="14">And he shall
breake it as the breaking of the potters vessell, that is broken in
pieces, he shall not spare; so that there shall not be found in the
bursting of it, a sheard to take fire from the hearth, or to take
water withall out of the pit.<note> Hebr. the bottell of potters.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">For thus saith
the Lord God, the Holy one of Israel, In returning and rest shall
ye be saued, in quietnesse and in confidence shalbe your strength,
and ye would not:</ab>
<ab n="16">But ye said; No,
for we will flee vpon horses; therefore shall ye flee. And we will
ride vpon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you, be
swift.</ab>
<ab n="17">One thousand
shall flee at the rebuke of one: at the rebuke of fiue, shall ye
flee, till ye be left as a beacon vpon the top of a mountaine, and
as an ensigne on a hill.<note> Or, a tree bereft of branches, or boughes, or a maste.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">¶ And
therefore wil the Lord wait that he may be gracious vnto you, and
therefore wil he be exalted that he may haue mercy vpon you: for
the Lord is a God of Iudgment. Blessed are all they that wait for
him.<note> Psal.2. 12. and 34.9. prou. 16. 20. iere.17. 7.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">For the people
shall dwel in Zion at Ierusalem: thou shalt weepe no more: hee will
be very gracious vnto thee, at the voice of thy cry; when he shall
heare it, he will answere thee.</ab>
<ab n="20">And though the
Lord giue you the bread of aduersitie, and the water of affliction,
yet shall not thy teachers be remooued into a corner any more: but
thine eyes shall see thy teachers.<note> Or, oppression.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">And thine eares
shall heare a word behinde thee, saying; This is the way, walke ye
in it, when ye turne to the right hand, and when ye turne to the
left.</ab>

<fw>Deuouring fire.</fw>
<ab n="22">Ye shall defile
also the couering of thy grauen images of siluer, and the ornament
of thy moulten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a
menstruous cloth, thou shalt say vnto it; Get thee
hence.<note> Hebr. the grauen images of thy siluer. , Hebr. scatter.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">Then shall he
giue the raine of thy seed that thou shalt sow the ground withall;
and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shalbe fat and
plenteous: in that day shall thy cattell feed in large
pastures.</ab>
<ab n="24">The oxen likewise
and the yong asses that eare the ground, shall eate cleane
prouender which hath bene winnowed with the shouell and with the
fanne.<note> Or, saucurie; Hebr. leauened.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">And there shall
be vpon euery high mountaine, and vpon euery high hill, riuers and
streames of waters, in the day of the great slaughter when the
towers fall.<note> Hebr. lifted vp.</note></ab>
<ab n="26">Moreouer the
light of the Moone shalbe as the light of the Sunne, and the light
of the Sunne shall be seuenfold, as the light of seuen dayes, in
the day that the Lord bindeth vp the breach of his people, and
healeth the stroke of their wound.</ab>
<ab n="27">¶ Beholde,
the Name of the Lord commeth from farre, burning with his anger,
and the burden thereof is heauy: his lips are full of indignation,
and his tongue as a deuouring fire.<note> Or, and the grieuousnes of flame. , Hebr. heauinesse.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">And his breath as
an ouerflowing streame, shall reach to the midst of the necke, to
sift the nations with the sieue of vanitie: and there shalbe a
bridle in the iawes of the people causing them to erre.</ab>
<ab n="29">Yee shall haue a
song as in the night, when a holy solemnitie is kept, and gladnesse
of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountaine
of the Lord, to the mighty one of Israel.<note> Heb. rocke.</note></ab>
<ab n="30">And the Lord
shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the
lighting downe of his arme, with the indignation of his anger, and
with the flame of a deuouring fire, with scattering and tempest and
hailestones.<note> Hebr. the glory of his voice.</note></ab>
<ab n="31">For through the
voyce of the Lord shall the Assyrian be beaten downe, which smote
with a rod.</ab>
<ab n="32">And in euery
place where the grounded staffe shall passe, which the Lord shall
lay vpon him, it shall be with tabrets and harpes: and in battels
of shaking will he fight with it.<note> Hebr. euery passing of the rod founded. , Hebr cause to rest vpon him. , Or, against them.</note></ab>

<fw>Vaine trust in man.</fw>
<ab n="33">For Tophet is
ordained of olde; yea, for the king it is prepared, he hath made it
deepe and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood, the breath
of the Lord, like a streame of brimstone, doeth kindle
it.<note> Heb. from yesterday.</note></ab>
