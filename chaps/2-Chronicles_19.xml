<ab n="2">And Iehu the
sonne of Hanani the seer, went out to meete him, and sayd to king
Iehoshaphat, Shouldest thou helpe the vngodly, and loue them that

faithfully, and with a perfect heart.</ab>
<ab n="10">And what
cause soeuer shal come to you of your brethren that dwell in their
cities, betweene blood and blood, betweene Law and Commandement,
Statutes and Iudgements, yee shall euen warne them that they
trespasse not against the Lord, and so wrath come vpon you, and
vpon your brethren: this doe, &amp; ye shall not trespasse.</ab>
<ab n="11">And behold,
Amariah the chiefe Priest is ouer you in all matters of the Lord,
and Zebadiah the sonne of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Iudah,
for all the Kings matters: Also the Leuites shall be officers
before you. Deale couragiously, and the Lord shalbe with the
good.<note> Hebr. take courage and doe.</note></ab>
