<head>CHAP. II.</head>
<head>1 Out of the choise of virgines, a
Queene is to be chosen. 5 Mordecai the nursing father of Esther. 8
Esther is preferred by Hegai before the rest. 12 The maner of
purification, &amp; going in to the king. 15 Esther best pleasing
the king, is made Queene. 21 Mordecai discouering a treason, is
recorded in the Chronicles.</head>

<ab n="1">After these
things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, hee
remembred Uasthi, and what shee had done, and what was decreed
against her.</ab>
<ab n="2">Then saide
the kings seruants, that ministred vnto him, Let there bee faire
yong virgins sought for the king:</ab>

<fw>The kings decree.</fw>
<ab n="3">And let the
king appoint officers in all the prouinces of his kingdome, that
they may gather together all the faire yong virgins vnto Shushan
the palace, to the house of the women vnto the custodie of Hege the
kings chamberlaine, keeper of the women, and let their things for
purification bee giuen them:<note> Heb. vnto the hand. , Or, Hegai, ver.8.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">And let the
maiden which pleaseth the king, bee Queene in stead of Uasthi. And
the thing pleased the king, and he did so.</ab>
<ab n="5">¶ Now in
Shushan the palace, there was a certaine Iew, whose name was
Mordecai, the sonne of Iair, the sonne of Shimei, the sonne of
Kish, a Beniamite,</ab>
<ab n="6">Who had bene
caried away from Ierusalem, with the captiuitie which had bene
caried away with Ieconiah king of Iudah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the
King of Babylon had caried away.<note> 2.King.24 15. ier.24.1 and 2.chro. 36.10.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">And hee
brought vp Hadassah (that is Esther) his vncles daughter, for she
had neither father nor mother, and the maid was faire and
beautiful, whom Mordecai (when her father and mother were dead)
tooke for his owne daughter.<note> Heb. nourished. , Heb. faire of fourme, and good of countenance.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">¶ So it
came to passe, when the kings commandement and his decree was
heard, and when many maidens were gathered together vnto Shushan
the palace, to the custodie of Hegai, that Esther was brought also
vnto the kings house, to the custodie of Hegai, keeper of the
women.</ab>
<ab n="9">And the
maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindnesse of him, and hee
speedily gaue her her things for purification, with such things as
belonged to her, and seuen maidens, which were meet to be giuen
her, out of the Kings house, and hee preferred her and her maids,
vnto the best place of the house of the women.<note> Heb. her portions. , Hebr. hee changed her.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">Esther had not
shewed her people, nor her kinred: for Mordecai had charged her,
that she should not shew it.</ab>
<ab n="11">And Mordecai
walked euery day before the court of the womens house, to know how
Esther did, and what should become of her.<note> Heb. to know the peace.</note></ab>

<fw>Esther Queene.</fw>
<ab n="12">¶ Now when
euery maids turne was come, to goe in to King Ahasnerus, after that
shee had bene twelue moneths, according to the maner of the women
(for so were the dayes of their purifications accomplished, to wit,
sixe moneths with oile of myrrhe, and sixe moneths with sweet
odours, and with other things for the purifying of the
women.)</ab>
<ab n="13">Then thus came
euery maiden vnto the king, whatsoeuer she desired, was giuen her,
to goe with her out of the house of the women, vnto the kings
house.</ab>
<ab n="14">In the euening she
went, and on the morrowe she returned into the second house of the
women, to the custodie of Shaashgaz the kings chamberlen, which
kept the concubines: shee came in vnto the king no more, except the
king delighted in her, and that shee were called by name.</ab>
<ab n="15">¶ Now when
the turne of Esther, the daughter of Abihail, the vncle of Mordecai
(who had taken her for his daughter) was come, to goe in vnto the
king: she required nothing, but what Hegai the kings chamberlen the
keeper of the women, appointed: And Esther obtained fauour in the
sight of all them that looked vpon her.</ab>
<ab n="16">So Esther was
taken vnto king Ahasuerus, into his house royall, in the tenth
moneth (which is the moneth Tebeth) in the seuenth yeere of his
reigne.</ab>
<ab n="17">And the king loued
Esther aboue all the women, and she obtained grace and fauour in
his sight, more then all the virgins; so that hee set the royall
crowne vpon her head, and made her queene, in stead of
Uasthi.<note> Or kindnesse. , Heb. before him.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Then the king made
a great feast vnto all his princes and his seruants, euen Esthers
feast, and hee made a release to the prouinces, and gaue gifts,
according to the state of the king.<note> Heb. rest.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">And when the
virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sate
in the kings gate.</ab>
<ab n="20">Esther had not yet
shewed her kindred, nor her people, as Mordecai had charged her:
For Esther did the commandement of Mordecai, like as when she was
brought vp with him.</ab>
<ab n="21">¶ In those
dayes, (while Mordecai sate in the kings gate) two of the kings
chamberlens, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the doore,
were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king
Ahasuerus:<note> Or, Bigthana. chap. 6.2. , Heb. the threshold.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">And the thing was
knowen to Mordecai, who told it vnto Esther the Queene, and Esther
certified the king thereof, in Mordecais name.</ab>

<fw>Hamans suit.</fw>
<ab n="23">And when
inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therfore they
were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the booke of the
chronicles before the king.</ab>
