<fw>Iehoshaphat: His fast, and
prayer.</fw>
<ab n="1">It came to
passe after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children
of Ammon, and with them, other beside the Ammonites, came against
Iehoshaphat to battell.</ab>
<ab n="2">Then there
came some that tolde Iehoshaphat, saying, There commeth a great
multitude against thee from beyond the Sea on this side Syria, and
behold, they bee in Hazazon-Tamar, which is En-gedi.</ab>
<ab n="3">And
Iehoshaphat feared, and set himselfe to seeke the Lord, and
proclaimed a fast throughout all Iudah.<note> Hebr. his face.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">And Iudah
gathered themselues together, to aske helpe of the Lord: euen out
of all the cities of Iudah they came to seeke the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="5">¶ And
Iehoshaphat stood in the Congregation of Iudah and Ierusalem, in
the house of the Lord before the new Court,</ab>
<ab n="6">And said, O
Lord God of our fathers, art not thou God in heauen? and rulest not
thou ouer all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is
there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand
thee?</ab>
<ab n="7">Art not thou
our God, who didst driue out the inhabitants of this land before
thy people Israel, and gauest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend
for euer?<note> Heb. thou.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">And they
dwelt therein, and haue built thee a Sanctuarie therein for thy
Name, saying,</ab>
<ab n="9">If, when
euill commeth vpon vs, as the sword, iudgement, or pestilence, or
famine, wee stand before this house, and in thy presence (for thy
Name is in this house) and cry vnto thee in our affliction, then
thou wilt heare &amp; helpe.<note> Chap.6. 28. 1.king. 8.37.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">And now
behold, the children of Ammon, and Moab, and mount Seir, whom thou
wouldest not let Israel inuade, when they came out of the land of
Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them
not:<note> Deut.2.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">Beholde, I
say, how they reward vs, to come to cast vs out of thy possession,
which thou hast giuen vs to inherit.</ab>

<fw>God fighteth for Iudah.</fw>
<ab n="12">O our God,
wilt thou not iudge them? for wee haue no might against this great
company that commeth against vs? neither know wee what to doe; but
our eyes are vpon thee.</ab>
<ab n="13">And all
Iudah stood before the Lord, with their litle ones, their wiues and
their children.</ab>
<ab n="14">¶ Then
vpon Iahaziel the sonne of Zechariah, the sonne of Benaiah, the
sonne of Iehiel, the sonne of Mattaniah, a Leuite of the sons of
Asaph, came the Spirit of the Lord in the midst of the
Congregation:</ab>
<ab n="15">And he
said, Hearken yee, all Iudah, and ye inhabitants of Ierusalem, and
thou king Iehoshaphat, Thus sayth the Lord vnto you; Be not afraid,
nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battell is
not yours, but Gods.</ab>
<ab n="16">To morrow
goe ye downe against them: behold, they come vp by the cliffe of
Ziz, and ye shall finde them at the end of the brooke, before the
wildernesse of Ieruel.<note> Heb. ascent. , Or, valley.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">Yee shall
not neede to fight in this battell; set your selues, stand yee
still, and see the saluation of the Lord with you, O Iudah and
Ierusalem: feare not, nor be dismayed; to morow goe out against
them, for the Lord will bee with you.</ab>
<ab n="18">And
Iehoshaphat bowed his head, with his face to the ground: and all
Iudah, and the inhabitants of Ierusalem, fell before the Lord,
worshipping the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="19">And the
Leuites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of
the Korhites, stood vp to praise the Lord God of Israel, with a
loude voice on high.</ab>
<ab n="20">¶ And
they rose early in the morning, and went foorth into the
wildernesse of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Iehoshaphat stood and
said, Heare me, O Iudah, and yee inhabitants of Ierusalem; Beleeue
in the Lord your God, so shall you be established; beleeue his
Prophets, so shall yee prosper.<note> Isai. 7.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">And when he
had consulted with the people, he appointed Singers vnto the Lord,
and that should praise the beautie of holinesse, as they went out
before the armie; and to say, Praise the Lord, for his mercy
endureth for euer.<note> Heb. praisers.</note></ab>

<fw>God fighteth for Iudah.</fw>
<ab n="22">¶ And
when they beganne to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments
against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were
come against Iudah, and they were smitten.<note> Heb. and in the time that they, &amp;c. , Heb. in singing and praise. , Or, they smote one another.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">For the
children of Ammon and Moab, stood vp against the inhabitants of
mount Seir, vtterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had
made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, euery one helped to destroy
another.<note> Heb. for the destruction.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">And when
Iudah came toward the watch-tower in the wildernesse, they looked
vnto the multitude, and behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the
earth, and none escaped.<note> Heb. there was not an escaping.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">And when
Iehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoile of them,
they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead
bodies, and precious iewels (which they stript off for themselues)
more then they could cary away: and they were three dayes in
gathering of the spoile, it was so much.</ab>
<ab n="26">¶ And
on the fourth day they assembled themselues in the valley of
Berachah; for there they blessed the Lord: therfore the name of the
same place was called the valley of Berachah vnto this
day.<note> That is, blessing.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">Then they
returned, euery man of Iudah and Ierusalem, and Iehoshaphat in the
forefront of them, to go againe to Ierusalem with ioy: for the Lord
had made them to reioyce ouer their enemies.<note> Heb. head.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">And they
came to Ierusalem with Psalteries, and harpes, and trumpets, vnto
the house of the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="29">And the
feare of God was on all the kingdoms of those countreys, when they
had heard that the Lord fought against the enemies of
Israel.</ab>
<ab n="30">So the
Realme of Iehoshaphat was quiet; for his God gaue him rest round
about.</ab>
<ab n="31">¶ And
Iehoshaphat reigned ouer Iudah: Hee was thirtie and fiue yeeres
olde when hee began to reigne, and he reigned twentie and fiue
yeeres in Ierusalem: and his mothers name was Azubah the daughter
of Shilhi.<note> 1.King. 22.41,&amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="32">And he
walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it,
doing that which was right in the sight of the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="33">Howbeit the
high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not
prepared their hearts vnto the God of their fathers.</ab>

<fw>Iehorams crueltie: His great
plague.</fw>
<ab n="34">Now the
rest of the actes of Iehoshaphat first and last, behold, they are
written in the booke of Iehu the sonne of Hanani; who is mentioned
in the booke of the Kings of Israel.<note> Heb. words. , 1.Kings 16.1. , Heb. was made to ascend.</note></ab>
<ab n="35">¶ And
after this did Iehoshaphat king of Iudah ioine himselfe with
Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:</ab>
<ab n="36">And he
ioyned himselfe with him to make ships to goe to Tarshish: and they
made the ships in Ezion-Geber.</ab>
<ab n="37">Then
Eliezer the sonne of Dodanah of Mareshah, prophesied against
Iehoshaphat, saying; Because thou hast ioyned thy selfe with
Ahaziah, the Lord hath broken thy workes: and the ships were
broken, that they were not able to goe to Tarshish.</ab>
