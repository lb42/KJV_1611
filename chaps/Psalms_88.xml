<head>CHAP.
LXXXVIII.</head>
<head>A prayer contayning a grieuous
complaint.</head>

<ab n="1">[A song or Psalme
for the sonnes of Korah, to the chiefe Musician vpon Mahalath
Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.] O Lord God of my
saluation, I haue cried day and night before thee.</ab>
<ab n="2">Let my prayer come
before thee: incline thine eare vnto my cry.</ab>
<ab n="3">For my soule is
full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh vnto the graue.</ab>
<ab n="4">I am counted with
them that go downe into the pit: I am as a man that hath no
strength.</ab>

<fw>Dauids complaint.</fw>
<ab n="5">Free among the
dead, like the slaine that lie in the graue, whom thou remembrest
no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.<note> Or, by thy hand.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">Thou hast laid me
in the lowest pit: in darkenesse, in the deepes.</ab>
<ab n="7">Thy wrath lieth
hard vpon me: and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waues.
Selah.</ab>
<ab n="8">Thou hast put away
mine acquaintance farre from mee: thou hast made me an abomination
vnto them: I am shut vp, and I cannot come forth.</ab>
<ab n="9">Mine eye mourneth
by reason of affliction, Lord, I haue called daily vpon thee: I
haue stretched out my hands vnto thee.</ab>
<ab n="10">Wilt thou shew
wonders to the dead? shal the dead arise and praise thee?
Selah.</ab>
<ab n="11">Shall thy louing
kindnesse be declared in the graue? or thy faithfulnesse in
destruction?</ab>
<ab n="12">Shall thy wonders
be knowen in the darke? and thy righteousnesse in the land of
forgetfulnesse?</ab>
<ab n="13">But vnto thee
haue I cried, O Lord, and in the morning shall my prayer preuent
thee.</ab>
<ab n="14">Lord, why castest
thou off my soule? why hidest thou thy face from me?</ab>
<ab n="15">I am afflicted
and ready to die, from my youth vp: while I suffer thy terrours, I
am distracted.</ab>
<ab n="16">Thy fierce wrath
goeth ouer me: thy terrours haue cut me off.</ab>
<ab n="17">They came round
about mee daily like water: they compassed mee about
together.<note> Or, all the day.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Louer and friend
hast thou put farre from me: and mine acquaintance into
darkenesse.</ab>
