<head>CHAP.
XII.</head>
<head>2 Be not liberall to the vngodly. 10
Trust not thine enemie, nor the wicked.</head>

<ab n="1">When thou
wilt doe good, know to wh≈ç thou doest it, so shalt thou be
thanked for thy benefites.</ab>
<ab n="2">Do good to
the godly man, and thou shalt find a recompence, and if not from
him, yet from the most high.</ab>
<ab n="3">There can
no good come to him that is alwayes occupied in euill: nor to him
that giueth no almes.</ab>
<ab n="4">Giue to
the godly man, and helpe not a sinner.</ab>
<ab n="5">Doe well
vnto him that is lowly, but giue not to the vngodly: hold backe thy
bread, and giue it not vnto him, lest he ouermaster thee thereby.
For [else] thou shalt receiue twice as much euill, for all the good
thou shalt haue done vnto him.</ab>
<ab n="6">For the
most High hateth sinners, and will repay vengeance vnto the
vngodly, and keepeth them against the mightie day of their
punishment.</ab>
<ab n="7">Giue vnto
the good, and helpe not the sinner.</ab>
<ab n="8">A friend
cannot be knowen in prosperitie, and an enemy cannot be hidden in
aduersitie.</ab>
<ab n="9">In the
prosperitie of a man, enemies will be grieued, but in his
aduersitie, euen a friend will depart.</ab>
<ab n="10">Neuer
trust thine enemie: for like as yron rusteth, so is his
wickednesse.<note> Or, brasse.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">Though he
humble himselfe, and goe crouching, yet take good heed, and beware
of him, and thou shalt bee vnto him, as if thou hadst wiped a
looking glasse, and thou shalt knowe that his rust hath not beene
altogether wiped away.</ab>
<ab n="12">Set him
not by thee, lest when he hath ouerthrowen thee, he stand vp in thy
place, neither let him sit at thy right hand, lest he seeke to take
thy seat, and thou at the last remember my wordes, and be pricked
therewith.</ab>
<ab n="13">Who will
pitie a charmer that is bitten with a serpent, or any such as come
nigh wilde beasts?</ab>
<ab n="14">So one
that goeth to a sinner, and is defiled with him in his sinnes, who
will pitie?<note> Or, mingled.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">For a
while hee will abide with thee, but if thou begin to fall, he wil
not tarie.</ab>
<ab n="16">An enemie
speaketh sweetly with his lippes, but in his heart he imagineth how
to throw thee into a pit: hee will weepe with his eyes, but if he
find opportunitie, hee will not be satisfied with
blood.<note> Ier.41.6.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">If
aduersitie come vpon thee, thou shalt find him there first, &amp;
though he pretend to helpe thee, yet shal he vndermine
thee.<note> Or, supplant.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">He will
shake his head and clap his handes, and whisper much, and change
his countenance.</ab>
