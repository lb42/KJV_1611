<head>CHAP.
XVII.</head>
<head>1 Christ prayeth to his Father to
glorifie him, 6 To preserue his Apostles 11 In vnitie, 17 And
trueth, 20 To glorifie them, and all other beleeuers with him in
heauen.</head>

<ab n="1">These words
spake Iesus, and lift vp his eyes to heauen, and said, Father, the
houre is come, glorifie thy Sonne, that thy Sonne also may glorifie
thee.</ab>
<ab n="2">As thou hast
giuen him power ouer all flesh, that he should giue eternall life
to as many as thou hast giuen him.<note> Mat.28. 18.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And this is
life eternall, that they might know thee the onely true God, and
Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</ab>
<ab n="4">I haue
glorified thee on the earth: I haue finished the worke which thou
gauest me to doe.</ab>
<ab n="5">And now O
Father, glorifie thou me, with thine owne selfe, with the glory
which I had with thee before the world was.</ab>
<ab n="6">I haue
manifested thy Name vnto the men which thou gauest me out of the
world: thine they were; and thou gauest them me; and they haue kept
thy word.</ab>

<fw>Christ prayeth for his
disciples.</fw>
<ab n="7">Now they haue
knowen that all things whatsoeuer thou hast giuen me, are of
thee.</ab>
<ab n="8">For I haue
giuen vnto them the words which thou gauest me, and they haue
receiued them, and haue knowen surely that I came out from thee,
and they haue beleeued that thou didst send me.<note> Chap. 16. 27.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">I pray for
them, I pray not for the world: but for them which thou hast giuen
me, for they are thine.</ab>
<ab n="10">And all mine are
thine, and thine are mine: and I am glorified in them.</ab>
<ab n="11">And now I am no
more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee.
Holy Father, keep through thine owne Name, those whom thou hast
giuen mee, that they may bee one, as we are.</ab>
<ab n="12">While I was with
them in the world, I kept them in thy Name: those that thou gauest
me, I haue kept, and none of them is lost, but the sonne of
perdition: that the Scripture might be fulfilled.<note> Psal.109. 7.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">And now come I to
thee, and these things I speake in the world, that they might haue
my ioy fulfilled in themselues.</ab>
<ab n="14">I haue giuen them
thy word, and the world hath hated them, because they are not of
the world, euen as I am not of the world.</ab>
<ab n="15">I pray not that
thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest
keepe them from the euill.</ab>
<ab n="16">They are not of the
world, euen as I am not of the world.</ab>
<ab n="17">Sanctifie them
through thy trueth: thy word is trueth.</ab>
<ab n="18">As thou hast sent
mee into the world: euen so haue I also sent them into the
world.</ab>
<ab n="19">And for their sakes
I sanctifie my selfe, that they also might be sanctified through
the trueth.<note> Or, truely sanctified.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">Neither pray I for
these alone; but for them also which shall beleeue on me through
their word:</ab>
<ab n="21">That they all may
be one, as thou Father art in mee, and I in thee, that they also
may bee one in vs: that the world may beleeue that thou hast sent
mee.</ab>
<ab n="22">And the glory which
thou gauest me, I haue giuen them: that they may be one, euen as we
are one:</ab>

<fw>Christ prayeth for his
disciples.</fw>
<ab n="23">I in them, and thou
in mee, that they may bee made perfect in one, and that the world
may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loued them, as thou hast
loued me.</ab>
<ab n="24">Father, I will that
they also whom thou hast giuen me, be with me where I am, that they
may behold my glory which thou hast giuen mee: for thou louedst mee
before the foundation of the world.<note> Chap. 12. 26.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">O righteous Father,
the world hath not knowen thee, but I haue knowen thee, and these
haue knowen that thou hast sent me.</ab>
<ab n="26">And I haue declared
vnto them thy Name, and will declare it: that the loue wherewith
thou hast loued mee, may be in them, and I in them.</ab>
