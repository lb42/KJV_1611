<head>1 Moses keepeth Iethros flocke. 2
God appeareth to him in a burning bush. 9 He sendeth him to deliuer
Israel. 14 The name of God. 15 His message to Israel.</head>

<ab n="1">Nowe Moses
kept the flocke of Iethro his father in law, the Priest of Midian:
and hee led the flocke to the backeside of the desert, and came to
the mountaine of God, euen to Horeb.</ab>

<fw>The bush burning.</fw>
<ab n="2">And the Angel
of the Lord appeared vnto him, in a flame of fire out of the midst
of a bush, and he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire,
and the bush was not consumed.<note> A&amp;s.7. 30.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And Moses
saide, I will nowe turne aside, and see this great sight, why the
bush is not burnt.</ab>
<ab n="4">And when the
Lord sawe that he turned aside to see, God called vnto him out of
the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he saide, Here
am I.</ab>
<ab n="5">And he said,
Drawe not nigh hither: put off thy shooes from off thy feete, for
the place whereon thou standest, is holy ground.<note> Iosh.5.15. acts.7.53.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">Moreouer hee
said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac, and the God of Iacob. And Moses hid his face: for he was
afraid to looke vpon God.<note> Matth.22. 32. acts.7. 32.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">¶ And
the Lord said, I haue surely seene the affliction of my people
which are in Egypt, and haue heard their crie, by reason of their
taske-masters: for I know their sorrowes,</ab>
<ab n="8">And I am come
downe to deliuer them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to
bring them vp out of that land, vnto a good land and a large, vnto
a lande flowing with milke and hony, vnto the place of the
Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites,
and the Hiuites, and the Iebusites.</ab>
<ab n="9">Now therefore
behold, the crie of the children of Israel is come vnto me: and I
haue also seene the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppresse
them.</ab>
<ab n="10">Come now
therefore, and I will send thee vnto Pharaoh, that thou mayest
bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.</ab>
<ab n="11">¶ And Moses
saide vnto God, Who am I, that I should goe vnto Pharaoh, and that
I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?</ab>
<ab n="12">And he said,
Certainely I will be with thee, and this shall be a token vnto
thee, that I haue sent thee: When thou hast brought foorth the
people out of Egypt, ye shall serue God vpon this
mountaine.</ab>
<ab n="13">And Moses saide
vnto God, Behold, when I come vnto the children of Israel, and
shall say vnto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me vnto you;
and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say vnto
them?</ab>

<fw>The Name of God.</fw>
<ab n="14">And God saide vnto
Moses, I AM THAT I AM: And he said, Thus shalt thou say vnto the
children of Israel, I AM hath sent me vnto you.</ab>
<ab n="15">And God said
moreouer vnto Moses, Thus shalt thou say vnto the children of
Israel; The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God
of Isaac, and the God of Iacob hath sent me vnto you: this is my
name for euer, and this is my memoriall vnto all
generations.</ab>
<ab n="16">Goe and gather the
Elders of Israel together, and say vnto them, The Lord God of your
fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Iacob appeared vnto
me, saying, I haue surely visited you, and seene that which is done
to you in Egypt.</ab>
<ab n="17">And I haue said, I
will bring you vp out of the affliction of Egypt, vnto the land of
the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the
Perizzites, and the Hiuites, and the Iebusites, vnto a land flowing
with milke and hony.</ab>
<ab n="18">And they shall
hearken to thy voyce: and thou shalt come, thou and the Elders of
Israel vnto the King of Egypt, and you shall say vnto him, The Lord
God of the Hebrewes hath met with vs: and now let vs goe, (wee
beseech thee) three dayes iourney into the wildernes, that we may
sacrifice to the Lord our God.</ab>
<ab n="19">¶ And I am
sure that the King of Egypt will not let you goe, no not by a
mightie hand.<note> Or, but by strong hand.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">And I will stretch
out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will doe
in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you goe.</ab>
<ab n="21">And I will giue
this people fauour in the sight of the Egyptians, and it shall come
to passe that when ye goe, ye shall not goe empty:</ab>
<ab n="22">But euery woman
shal borrow of her neighbour, and of her that soiourneth in her
house, iewels of siluer, and iewels of gold, and rayment: and ye
shall put them vpon your sonnes and vpon your daughters, and yee
shall spoile the Egyptians.<note> Chap.11. 2. &amp; 12.35. , Or, Egypt.</note></ab>
