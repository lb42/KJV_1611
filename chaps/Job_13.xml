<fw>Abram and Lot.</fw>
<ab n="1">And Abram went vp
out of Egypt, he and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with
him, into the South.</ab>
<ab n="2">And Abram was
very rich in cattell, in siluer, and in gold.</ab>
<ab n="3">And hee went on
his iourneyes from the South, euen to Beth-el, vnto the place where
his tent had bene at the beginning, betweene Beth-el and
Hai:</ab>
<ab n="4">Unto the place of
the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram
called on the Name of the LORD.<note> Chap.12. 7.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">¶ And Lot
also which went with Abram, had flocks and heards, &amp;
tents.</ab>
<ab n="6">And the land was
not able to beare them, that they might dwell together: for their
substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.</ab>
<ab n="7">And there was a
strife betweene the heardmen of Abrams cattell, and the heardmen of
Lots cattell: And the Canaanite, and the Perizzite dwelled then in
the land.</ab>
<ab n="8">And Abram said
vnto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, betweene mee and
thee, and betweene my heardmen and thy heardmen: for wee bee
brethren.<note> Hebr. men brethren.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">Is not the whole
land before thee? Separate thy selfe, I pray thee, from mee: if
thou wilt take the left hand, then I will goe to the right: or if
thou depart to the right hand, then I will goe to the left.</ab>
<ab n="10">And Lot lifted
vp his eyes, and beheld all the plaine of Iordane, that it was well
watered euery where before the Lord destroyed Sodome and Gomorah,
euen as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou
commest vnto Zoar.</ab>
<ab n="11">Then Lot chose
him all the plaine of Iordane: and Lot iourneyed East; and they
separated themselues the one from the other.</ab>
<ab n="12">Abram dwelled in
the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plaine,
and pitched his tent toward Sodome.</ab>
<ab n="13">But the men of
Sodome were wicked, and sinners before the LORD
exceedingly.</ab>

<fw>Gods promise.</fw>
<ab n="14">¶ And the
LORD said vnto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift
vp now thine eyes, and looke from the place where thou art,
Northward, and Southward, and Eastward, and Westward.</ab>
<ab n="15">For all the land
which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seede for
euer.<note> Chap. 12. 7. and 26. 4. deut. 34. 4.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">And I will make
thy seede as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the
dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbred.</ab>
<ab n="17">Arise, walke
through the land, in the length of it, and in the breadth of it:
for I will giue it vnto thee.</ab>
<ab n="18">Then Abram
remoued his tent, and came and dwelt in the plaine of Mamre, which
is in Hebron, and built there an altar vnto the LORD.<note> Hebr. plaines.</note></ab>
