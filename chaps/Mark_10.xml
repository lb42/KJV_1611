<head>CHAP. X.</head>
<head>2 Christ disputeth with the
Pharisees, touching diuorcement: 13 blesseth the children that are
brought vnto him: 17 resolueth a rich man how he may inherite life
euerlasting: 23 telleth his disciples of the danger of riches: 28
promiseth rewards to them that forsake any thing for the Gospell:
32 Foretelleth his death, &amp; resurrection: 35 Biddeth the two
ambitious suiters to thinke rather of suffring with him: 46 And
restoreth to Bartimeus his sight.</head>

<ab n="1">And he rose
from thence, &amp; commeth into the coasts of Iudea by the farther
side of Iordan: and the people resort vnto him againe, and as he
was wont, he taught them againe.<note> Mat.19.1.</note></ab>

<fw>Of diuorcement.</fw>
<ab n="2">¶ And the
Pharises came to him, and asked him, Is it lawfull for a man to put
away his wife? tempting him.</ab>
<ab n="3">And he
answered, and saide vnto them, What did Moses command you?</ab>
<ab n="4">And they said,
Moses suffered to write a bill of diuorcement, and to put her
away.</ab>
<ab n="5">And Iesus
answered, and said vnto them, For the hardnesse of your heart, he
wrote you this precept.</ab>
<ab n="6">But from the
beginning of the creation, God made them male, and female.</ab>
<ab n="7">For this cause
shall a man leaue his father and mother, and cleaue to his
wife,</ab>
<ab n="8">And they
twaine shalbe one flesh: so then they are no more twaine, but one
flesh.</ab>
<ab n="9">What therefore
God hath ioyned together, let not man put asunder.</ab>
<ab n="10">And in the house
his disciples asked him againe of the same matter.</ab>
<ab n="11">And he saith vnto
them, Whosoeuer shall put away his wife, and marry another,
committeth adultery against her.<note> Matth.5. 32. and 19. 9.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">And if a woman
shall put away her husband, and bee married to another, she
committeth adulterie.</ab>
<ab n="13">¶ And they
brought yong children to him, that he should touch them, and his
disciples rebuked those that brought them.<note> Matth.19. 13.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">But when Iesus saw
it, hee was much displeased, and said vnto them, Suffer the little
children to come vnto mee, and forbid them not: for of such is the
kingdome of God.</ab>
<ab n="15">Uerily I say vnto
you, Whosoeuer shall not receiue the kingdome of God as a little
childe, he shall not enter therein.</ab>
<ab n="16">And hee tooke them
vp in his armes, put his handes vpon them, and blessed
them.</ab>
<ab n="17">¶ And when he
was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to
him, and asked him, Good master, what shall I doe that I may
inherit eternall life?<note> Matth.19. 16.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">And Iesus said vnto
him, Why callest thou me good? There is no man good, but one, that
is God.</ab>
<ab n="19">Thou knowest the
Commandements, Doe not commit adulterie, Doe not kill, Doe not
steale, Doe not beare false witnesse, Defraud not, Honour thy
father, and mother.</ab>

<fw>The first, last.</fw>
<ab n="20">And hee answered,
and saide vnto him, Master, all these haue I obserued from my
youth.</ab>
<ab n="21">Then Iesus
beholding him, loued him, and said vnto him, One thing thou
lackest; Goe thy way, sell whatsoeuer thou hast, and giue to the
poore, and thou shalt haue treasure in heauen, and come, take vp
the crosse &amp; folow me.</ab>
<ab n="22">And hee was sad at
that saying, and went away grieued: for hee had great
possessions.</ab>
<ab n="23">¶ And Iesus
looked round about, and saith vnto his disciples, How hardly shall
they that haue riches enter into the kingdome of God?</ab>
<ab n="24">And the disciples
were astonished at his words. But Iesus answereth againe, and saith
vnto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches,
to enter into the kingdom of God?</ab>
<ab n="25">It is easier for a
camel to goe thorow the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to
enter into the kingdom of God.</ab>
<ab n="26">And they were
astonished out of measure, saying among themselues, Who then can be
saued?</ab>
<ab n="27">And Iesus looking
vpon them, saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for
with God all things are possible.</ab>
<ab n="28">¶ Then Peter
began to say vnto him, Loe, we haue left all, and haue followed
thee.<note> Matth.19. 27.</note></ab>
<ab n="29">And Iesus answered,
and said, Uerily I say vnto you, There is no man that hath left
house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or
children, or lands, for my sake, and the Gospels,</ab>
<ab n="30">But hee shall
receiue an hundred fold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and
sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions;
and in the world to come eternall life:</ab>
<ab n="31">But many that are
first, shall be last: and the last, first.<note> Matth.19. 30.</note></ab>
<ab n="32">¶ And they
were in the way going vp to Hierusalem: and Iesus went before them,
and they were amazed, and as they followed, they were afraid: and
he tooke againe the twelue, and began to tell them what things
should happen vnto him,<note> Matth.20. 17.</note></ab>
<ab n="33">Saying, Behold, we
go vp to Hierusalem, and the Sonne of man shall be deliuered vnto
the chiefe Priests, and vnto the Scribes: and they shall condemne
him to death, and shall deliuer him to the Gentiles.</ab>

<fw>Christs cup, &amp;c.</fw>
<ab n="34">And they shall
mocke him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit vpon him, and
shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise againe.</ab>
<ab n="35">¶ And Iames,
and Iohn the sonnes of Zebedee come vnto him, saying, Master, we
would þt thou shouldest do for vs whatsoeuer we
shall desire.<note> Matth.20. 20.</note></ab>
<ab n="36">And hee saide vnto
them, What would ye that I should doe for you?</ab>
<ab n="37">They said vnto him,
Grant vnto vs that wee may sit, one on thy right hand, and the
other on thy left hand, in thy glory.</ab>
<ab n="38">But Iesus said vnto
them, Yee know not what ye aske: Can ye drinke of the cup that I
drinke of? and be baptized with the baptisme that I am baptized
with?</ab>
<ab n="39">And they said vnto
him, Wee can. And Iesus said vnto them, Ye shall indeed drinke of
the cup that I drinke of: and with the baptisme that I am baptized
withall, shall ye be baptized:</ab>
<ab n="40">But to sit on my
right hand and on my left hand, is not mine to giue, but it shall
be giuen to them for whom it is prepared.</ab>
<ab n="41">And when the ten
heard it, they beganne to bee much displeased with Iames and
Iohn.</ab>
<ab n="42">But Iesus called
them to him, and saith vnto them, Yee know that they which are
accompted to rule ouer the Gentiles, exercise Lordship ouer them:
and their great ones exercise authoritie vpon them.<note> Luke 22. 25. , Or, thinke good.</note></ab>
<ab n="43">But so shall it not
be among you: but whosoeuer will bee great among you, shall be your
minister:</ab>
<ab n="44">And whosoeuer of
you will bee the chiefest, shalbe seruant of all.</ab>
<ab n="45">For euen the Sonne
of man came not to bee ministred vnto, but to minister, and to giue
his life a ransome for many.</ab>
<ab n="46">¶ And they
came to Iericho: and as he went out of Iericho with his disciples,
and a great number of people; blinde Bartimeus, the son of Timeus,
sate by the high wayes side, begging.<note> Matth.20. 19.</note></ab>
<ab n="47">And when he heard
that it was Iesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Iesus
thou Sonne of Dauid, haue mercie on me.</ab>
<ab n="48">And many charged
him, that he should hold his peace: But he cried the more a great
deale, Thou Sonne of Dauid, haue mercy on me.</ab>

<fw>Sight restored.</fw>
<ab n="49">And Iesus stood
still, and commanded him to bee called: and they call the blinde
man, saying vnto him, Be of good comfort, rise, he calleth
thee.</ab>
<ab n="50">And hee casting
away his garment, rose, and came to Iesus.</ab>
<ab n="51">And Iesus answered,
and said vnto him, What wilt thou that I should doe vnto thee? The
blinde man said vnto him, Lord, that I might receiue my
sight.</ab>
<ab n="52">And Iesus saide
vnto him, Goe thy way, thy faith hath made thee whole: And
immediatly hee receiued his sight, &amp; followed Iesus in the
way.<note> Or, saued thee.</note></ab>
