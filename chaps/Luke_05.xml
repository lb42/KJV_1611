<head>CHAP. V.</head>
<head>1 Christ teacheth the people out of
Peters ship. 4 In a miraculous taking of fishes, sheweth how he wil
make him and his partners fishers of men: 12 Cleanseth the leper:
16 Prayeth in the wildernesse: 18 Healeth one sicke of the palsie:
27 Calleth Matthew the Publicane: 29 Eateth with sinners, as being
the Physician of soules: 34 Foretelleth the fastings and
afflictions of the Apostles after his ascension: 36 And likeneth
faint hearted and weake disciples, to olde bottels and worne
garments.</head>

<ab n="1">And it came to
passe, that as the people preassed vpon him to heare the word of
God, hee stood by the lake of Genesareth,<note> Mat. 4.18.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And sawe two
ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of
them, and were washing their nets.</ab>
<ab n="3">And he entred
into one of the ships, which was Simons, and prayed him, that he
would thrust out a little from the land: and he sate downe, and
taught the people out of the ship.</ab>
<ab n="4">Now when he had
left speaking, he said vnto Simon, Lanch out into the deepe, and
let downe your nets for a draught.</ab>
<ab n="5">And Simon
answering, said vnto him, Master, wee haue toiled all the night,
and haue taken nothing: neuerthelesse at thy word I will let downe
the net.</ab>
<ab n="6">And when they
had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their
net brake:</ab>
<ab n="7">And they
beckened vnto their partners, which were in the other ship, that
they should come and helpe them. And they came, &amp; filled both
the ships, so that they began to sinke.</ab>
<ab n="8">When Simon
Peter saw it, he fell downe at Iesus knees, saying, Depart from me,
for I am a sinfull man, O Lord.</ab>
<ab n="9">For he was
astonished, and al that were with him, at the draught of the fishes
which they had taken.</ab>
<ab n="10">And so was
also Iames, and Iohn the sonnes of Zebedee, which were partners
with Simon. And Iesus said vnto Simon, Feare not, from henceforth
thou shalt catch men.</ab>

<fw>A leper cleansed.</fw>
<ab n="11">And when they
had brought their ships to land, they forsooke all, and followed
him.</ab>
<ab n="12">¶ And it
came to passe, when he was in a certaine citie, behold a man full
of leprosie: who seeing Iesus, fell on his face, &amp; besought
him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me
cleane.<note> Mat 8.2.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">And he put
forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I wil: be thou cleane. And
immediatly the leprosie departed from him.</ab>
<ab n="14">And hee
charged him to tell no man: but, Goe, and shewe thy selfe to the
Priest, and offer for thy clensing, according as Moses commanded,
for a testimonie vnto them.</ab>
<ab n="15">But so much
the more went there a fame abroad of him, and great multitudes came
together to heare, and to be healed by him of their
infirmities.</ab>
<ab n="16">¶ And he
withdrew himselfe into the wildernesse, and prayed.</ab>
<ab n="17">And it came to
passe on a certaine day, as hee was teaching, that there were
Pharisees and Doctours of the Law sitting by, which were come out
of euery towne of Galilee, and Iudea, and Hierusalem: and the power
of the Lord was present to heale them.</ab>
<ab n="18">¶ And
behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsie:
and they sought meanes to bring him in, and to lay him before
him.<note> Mat.9.2.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">And when they
could not find by what way they might bring him in, because of the
multitude, they went vpon the house top, &amp; let him downe
through the tiling with his couch, into the midst before
Iesus.</ab>
<ab n="20">And when he
saw their faith, hee said vnto him, Man, thy sinnes are forgiuen
thee.</ab>
<ab n="21">And the
Scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this
which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgiue sinnes, but God
alone?</ab>
<ab n="22">But when Iesus
perceiued their thoughts, he answering, saide vnto them, What
reason ye in your hearts?</ab>
<ab n="23">Whether is
easier to say, Thy sinnes be forgiuen thee: or to say, Rise vp and
walke?</ab>
<ab n="24">But that ye
may know that the Sonne of man hath power vpon earth to forgiue
sinnes (he said vnto the sicke of the palsie,) I say vnto thee,
Arise, and take vp thy couch, and go into thine house.</ab>

<fw>Matthew called.</fw>
<ab n="25">And immediatly
he rose vp before them, and tooke vp that whereon hee lay, and
departed to his owne house, glorifying God.</ab>
<ab n="26">And they were
all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with feare,
saying, Wee haue seene strange things to day.</ab>
<ab n="27">¶ And
after these things hee went foorth, and sawe a Publicane, named
Leui, sitting at the receit of custome: and hee said vnto him,
Follow me.<note> Mat.9.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">And he left
all, rose vp, and followed him.</ab>
<ab n="29">And Leui made
him a great feast in his owne house: and there was a great company
of Publicanes, and of others that sate downe with them.</ab>
<ab n="30">But their
Scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why
doe ye eate and drinke with Publicanes and sinners?</ab>
<ab n="31">And Iesus
answering, said vnto them, They that are whole need not a
physician: but they that are sicke.</ab>
<ab n="32">I came not to
call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</ab>
<ab n="33">¶ And
they said vnto him, Why doe the disciples of Iohn fast often, and
make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees: but
thine eat and drinke?<note> Mat.9.14.</note></ab>
<ab n="34">And he said
vnto them, Can yee make the children of the Bride-chamber fast,
while the Bridegrome is with them?</ab>
<ab n="35">But the dayes
will come, when the Bridegrome shall bee taken away from them, and
then shall they fast in those dayes.</ab>
<ab n="36">¶ And he
spake also a parable vnto them, No man putteth a piece of a newe
garment vpon an olde: if otherwise, then both the newe maketh a
rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new, agreeth not with
the olde.</ab>
<ab n="37">And no man
putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine will burst the
bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.</ab>
<ab n="38">But newe wine
must be put into newe bottles, and both are preserued.</ab>
<ab n="39">No man also
hauing drunke olde wine, straightway desireth new: for he saith,
The old is better.</ab>
