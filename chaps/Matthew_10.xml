<head>CHAP. X.</head>
<head>1 Christ sendeth out his twelue
Apostles, enabling them with power to doe miracles, 5 giueth them
their charge, teacheth them, 16 comforteth them against
persecutions: 40 and promiseth a blessing to those that receiue
them.</head>

<ab n="1">And when hee had
called vnto him his twelue disciples, he gaue them power against
vncleane spirits, to cast them out, and to heale all maner of
sickenesse, and all maner of disease.<note> Mar.3.15. luke 9.1. , Or, ouer.</note></ab>

<fw>The Apostles are sent out.</fw>
<ab n="2">Now the names of
the twelue Apostles are these: The first, Simon, who is called
Peter, and Andrew his brother, Iames the sonne of Zebedee, and Iohn
his brother:</ab>
<ab n="3">Philip, and
Bartholomew, Thomas, and Matthew the Publicane, Iames the sonne of
Alpheus, and Lebbeus, whose surname was Thaddeus:</ab>
<ab n="4">Simon the
Canaanite, and Iudas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</ab>
<ab n="5">These twelue
Iesus sent foorth, and commanded them, saying, Goe not into the way
of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye
not:</ab>
<ab n="6">But goe rather to
the lost sheepe of the house of Israel.<note> Acts 13.46.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">And as yee goe,
preach, saying, The kingdome of heauen is at hand:<note> luke 10.9</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Heale the sicke,
cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out deuils: freely ye haue
receiued, freely giue.</ab>
<ab n="9">Prouide neither
gold, nor siluer, nor brasse in your purses:<note> Mark.6.8. luke 9.3. and 22.35. , Or, get.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">Nor scrippe for
your iourney, neither two coats, neither shooes, nor yet staues:
(for the workeman is worthy of his meat.)<note> 1.Tim.5.18. luke 10.7.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And into
whatsoeuer city or towne ye shall enter, inquire who in it is
worthy, and there abide till yee goe thence.<note> Luk.10.8.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">And when ye come
into an house, salute it.</ab>
<ab n="13">And if the house
be worthy, let your peace come vpon it: but if it be not worthy,
let your peace returne to you.</ab>
<ab n="14">And whosoeuer
shall not receiue you, nor heare your words: when yee depart out of
that house, or city, shake off the dust of your feete.<note> Mar.6.11. , Acts 13.51.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">Uerely I say
vnto you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and
Gomorrha in the day of iudgment, then for that citie.</ab>
<ab n="16">¶ Behold, I
send you foorth as sheepe in the middest of wolues: be yee
therefore wise as serpents, and harmelesse as doues.<note> Luk.10.3. , Or, simple.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">But beware of
men: for they will deliuer you vp to the Councils, and they will
scourge you in their Synagogues,</ab>
<ab n="18">And yee shall be
brought before Gouernours and Kings for my sake, for a testimonie
against them, and the Gentiles.</ab>
<ab n="19">But when they
deliuer you vp, take no thought, how or what ye shall speake, for
it shall bee giuen you in that same houre what ye shall
speake.<note> Marke 13.11. luke 12.11.</note></ab>

<fw>The Apostles are sent out.</fw>
<ab n="20">For it is not
yee that speake, but the Spirit of your Father, which speaketh in
you.</ab>
<ab n="21">And the brother
shall deliuer vp the brother to death, and the father the childe:
and the children shall rise vp against their parents, and cause
them to be put to death.<note> Luke 21.16.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">And yee shall be
hated of all men for my Names sake: but he that endureth to the
end, shalbe saued.<note> Mark. 13.13.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">But when they
persecute you in this citie, flee ye into another: for verely I say
vnto you, ye shall not haue gone ouer the cities of Israel, till
the Sonne of man be come.<note> Or, end or finish.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">The disciple is
not aboue his master, nor the seruant aboue his lord.<note> Luk.6.40. iohn 13.16.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">It is enough for
the disciple that he be as his master, and the seruant as his Lord:
If they haue called the Master of the house of Beelzebub, how much
more shall they call them of his household?</ab>
<ab n="26">Feare them not
therefore: for there is nothing couered, that shall not be
reueiled; and hidde, that shall not be knowen.<note> Mar.4.22. luke 8.17. and 12.2.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">What I tell you
in darkenesse, that speake yee in light: and what yee heare in the
eare, that preach yee vpon the house tops.</ab>
<ab n="28">And feare not
them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soule: but
rather feare him which is able to destroy both soule and body in
hell.<note> Luk.12.4.</note></ab>
<ab n="29">Are not two
Sparrowes solde for a farthing? And one of them shall not fall on
the ground without your Father.<note> It is in value halfepeny far thing, in the originall: as being the tenth part of the Romane peny.</note></ab>
<ab n="30">But the very
haires of your head are all numbred.<note> 2.Sam.14.11. actes 27.34.</note></ab>
<ab n="31">Feare yee not
therefore, ye are of more value then many Sparrowes.</ab>
<ab n="32">Whosoeuer
therefore shall confesse mee before men, him will I confesse also
before my Father which is in heauen.<note> Luk.12.8.</note></ab>
<ab n="33">But whosoeuer
shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father
which is in heauen.<note> Mar.8.38. luke 9.26. 2.tim.2.12.</note></ab>
<ab n="34">Thinke not that
I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a
sword.<note> Luke 12.51.</note></ab>
<ab n="35">For I am come to
set a man at variance against his father, &amp; the daughter
against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in
law.<note> Mic. 7.6.</note></ab>

<fw>To take the crosse.</fw>
<ab n="36">And a mans foes
shalbe they of his owne houshold.</ab>
<ab n="37">He that loueth
father or mother more then me, is not worthy of me: and he that
loueth sonne or daughter more then me, is not worthy of
me.<note> Luke 14.26.</note></ab>
<ab n="38">And he that
taketh not his crosse, and followeth after me, is not worthy of
me.<note> Chap. 16. 24. luke. 9. 23. mar. 8. 34.</note></ab>
<ab n="39">He that findeth
his life, shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake,
shall find it.<note> Iohn 12. 25.</note></ab>
<ab n="40">¶ He that
receiueth you, receiueth me: and he that receiueth mee, receiueth
him that sent me.<note> Luk. 10. 16. ioh. 13. 20.</note></ab>
<ab n="41">He that
receiueth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall receiue a
Prophets reward: and he that receiueth a righteous man, in the name
of a righteous man, shal receiue a righteous mans reward.</ab>
<ab n="42">And whosoeuer
shall giue to drinke vnto one of these litle ones, a cup of cold
water onely, in the name of a disciple, verily I say vnto you, hee
shall in no wise lose his reward.<note> Mar. 9. 41</note></ab>
