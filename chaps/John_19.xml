<head>CHAP.
XIX.</head>
<head>1 Christ is scourged, crowned with
thornes, and beaten. 4 Pilate is desirous to release him, but being
ouercome with the outrage of the Iewes, he deliuered him to bee
crucified. 23 They cast lots for his garments. 26 He commendeth his
mother to Iohn. 28 Hee dieth. 31 His side is pierced. 38 He is
buried by Ioseph and Nicodemus.</head>

<ab n="1">Then Pilate
therfore tooke Iesus, and scourged him.<note> Matth.27. 26.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And the
souldiers platted a crowne of thornes, and put it on his head, and
they put on him a purple robe,</ab>
<ab n="3">And said,
Haile king of the Iewes: and they smote him with their
hands.</ab>
<ab n="4">Pilate
therefore went foorth againe, and saith vnto them, Behold, I bring
him foorth to you, that yee may know that I find no fault in
him.</ab>
<ab n="5">Then came
Iesus forth, wearing the crowne of thornes, and the purple robe:
and Pilate saith vnto them, Behold the man.</ab>
<ab n="6">When the
chiefe Priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out,
saying, Crucifie him, crucifie him. Pilate saith vnto them, Take ye
him, and crucifie him: for I find no fault in him.</ab>
<ab n="7">The Iewes
answered him, We haue a law, and by our law he ought to die,
because hee made himselfe the Son of God.</ab>
<ab n="8">¶ When
Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid,</ab>
<ab n="9">And went
againe into the iudgement hall, &amp; saith vnto Iesus, Whence art
thou? But Iesus gaue him no answere.</ab>
<ab n="10">Then saith Pilate
vnto him, Speakest thou not vnto me? Knowest thou not, that I haue
power to crucifie thee, and haue power to release thee?</ab>

<fw>Christ crucified.</fw>
<ab n="11">Iesus answered,
Thou couldest haue no power at all against me, except it were giuen
thee from aboue: therfore he that deliuered me vnto thee, hath the
greater sinne.</ab>
<ab n="12">And from thencefore
Pilate sought to release him: but the Iewes cried out, saying, If
thou let this man goe, thou art not Cesars friend: whosoeuer maketh
himselfe a king, speaketh against Cesar.</ab>
<ab n="13">¶ When Pilate
therefore heard that saying, he brought Iesus foorth, and sate
downe in the iudgement seate, in a place that is called the
pauement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</ab>
<ab n="14">And it was the
preparation of the Passeouer, and about the sixt houre: and he
saith vnto the Iewes, Beholde your King.</ab>
<ab n="15">But they cried out,
Away with him, away with him, crucifie him. Pilate saith vnto them,
Shall I crucifie your King? The chiefe Priests answered, Wee haue
no king but Cesar.</ab>
<ab n="16">Then deliuered he
him therfore vnto them to be crucified: and they took Iesus, and
led him away.<note> Matth.27. 31.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">And he bearing his
crosse, went foorth into a place called the place of a skull, which
is called in the Hebrewe, Golgotha:</ab>
<ab n="18">Where they
crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and
Iesus in the middest.</ab>
<ab n="19">¶ And Pilate
wrote a title, and put it on the crosse. And the writing was, IESVS
OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE IEWES.</ab>
<ab n="20">This title then
read many of the Iewes: for the place where Iesus was crucified,
was nigh to the citie, and it was written in Hebrewe, and Greeke,
and Latine.</ab>
<ab n="21">Then said the
chiefe Priests of the Iewes to Pilate, Write not, The king of the
Iewes: but that he said, I am King of the Iewes.</ab>
<ab n="22">Pilate answered,
What I haue written, I haue written.</ab>
<ab n="23">¶ Then the
souldiers, when they had crucified Iesus, tooke his garments, (and
made foure parts, to euery souldier a part) and also his coat: Now
the coate was without seame, wouen from the top
thorowout.<note> Matth.27 35. , Or, wrought.</note></ab>

<fw>His death, and honourable
buriall.</fw>
<ab n="24">They said therefore
among themselues, Let not vs rent it, but cast lots for it, whose
it shall bee: that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, which saith,
They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast
lots. These things therefore the souldiers did.<note> Psal.22.18</note></ab>
<ab n="25">¶ Now there
stood by the crosse of Iesus, his mother, and his mothers sister,
Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.<note> Or, Clopas.</note></ab>
<ab n="26">When Iesus
therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he
loued, he saith vnto his mother, Woman, behold thy sonne.</ab>
<ab n="27">Then saith he to
the disciple, Behold thy mother. And from that houre that disciple
tooke her vnto his owne home.</ab>
<ab n="28">¶ After this,
Iesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the
Scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.<note> Psal.69. 12.</note></ab>
<ab n="29">Now there was set a
vessell, full of vineger: And they filled a spunge with vineger,
and put it vpon hyssope, and put it to his mouth.</ab>
<ab n="30">When Iesus
therefore had receiued the vineger, he said, It is finished, and he
bowed his head, and gaue vp the ghost.</ab>
<ab n="31">The Iewes
therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should
not remaine vpon the Crosse on the Sabbath day (for that Sabbath
day was an high day) besought Pilate that their legs might be
broken, and that they might be taken away.</ab>
<ab n="32">Then came the
souldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other, which
was crucified with him.</ab>
<ab n="33">But when they came
to Iesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his
legs.</ab>
<ab n="34">But one of the
souldiers with a speare pierced his side, and forthwith came there
out blood and water.</ab>
<ab n="35">And he that saw it,
bare record, and his record is true, and he knoweth that hee saith
true, that yee might beleeue.</ab>
<ab n="36">For these things
were done, that the Scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him
shall not be broken.<note> Num.9. 12. exod.12 46. , Psa.34.21</note></ab>
<ab n="37">And againe another
Scripture saith, They shall looke on him whom they
piersed.<note> Zach.12. 10.</note></ab>
<ab n="38">¶ And after
this, Ioseph of Arimathea (being a disciple of Iesus, but secretly
for feare of the Iewes) besought Pilate that he might take away the
body of Iesus, and Pilate gaue him leaue: he came therefore, and
tooke the body of Iesus.<note> Mat.27. 57.</note></ab>

<fw>His death, and honourable
buriall.</fw>
<ab n="39">And there came also
Nicodemus, which at the first came to Iesus by night, and brought a
mixture of myrrhe and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.</ab>
<ab n="40">Then tooke they the
body of Iesus, &amp; wound it in linnen clothes, with the spices,
as the maner of the Iewes is to burie:</ab>
<ab n="41">Now in the place
where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new
Sepulchre, wherein was neuer man yet layd.</ab>
<ab n="42">There laid they
Iesus therefore, because of the Iewes preparation day, for the
Sepulchre was nigh at hand.</ab>
