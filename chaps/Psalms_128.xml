degrees.] Blessed is euery one that feareth the Lord: that walketh

eat the labour of thine handes: happie shalt thou bee, and it shall

as a fruitful Uine by the sides of thine house, thy children like
Oliue plants: round about thy table.</ab>

blesse thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Ierusalem,
all the dayes of thy life.</ab>
