<head>CHAP. I.</head>
<head>1 Amos sheweth Gods iudgement vpon
Syria, 6 vpon the Philistines, 9 vpon Tyrus, 11 vpon Edom, 13 vpon
Ammon.</head>

<ab n="1">The wordes of
Amos, who was among the heardmen of Tekoa, which hee sawe
concerning Israel, in the daies of Uzziah King of Iudah, and in the
dayes of Ieroboam the sonne of Ioash king of Israel, two yere
before the earthquake.<note> Zech.14. 5.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And he said,
The Lord will roare from Zion, and vtter his voice from Ierusalem:
and the habitations of the shepheards shall mourne, and the top of
Carmel shall wither.<note> Iere.25. 30. ioel 3. 18.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">Thus saith the
Lord; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for foure I wil not
turne away the punishment thereof, because they haue threshed
Gilead, with threshing instruments of yron.<note> Or, he for foure. , Or, conuert it, or let it be quiet. And so ver. 6. &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">But I will send
a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall deuoure the palaces of
Benhadad.</ab>
<ab n="5">I wil breake
also the barre of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the
plaine of Auen: and him that holdeth the scepter from the house of
Eden, and the people of Syria shall goe into captiuitie, vnto Kir,
saith the Lord.<note> Or, Bikath Amen. , Or, Beth-Eden.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">¶ Thus
saith the Lord, For three transgressions of Gaza, and for foure I
will not turne away the punishment thereof: because they caried
away captiue the whole captiuitie, to deliuer them vp to
Edom.<note> 2.Chro. 28.18. , Or, caried them away with an entire captiuitie.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">But I wil send
a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall deuoure the palaces
thereof.</ab>
<ab n="8">And I wil cut
off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the scepter
from Ashkelon, and I wil turne mine hand against Ekron; and the
remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord
God.</ab>
<ab n="9">¶ Thus
saith the Lord, For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for foure I
wil not turne away the punishment thereof, because they deliuered
vp the whole captiuitie to Edom, and remembred not the brotherly
couenant.<note> Hebr. the couenant of brethren.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">But I wil send
a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall deuoure the palaces
thereof.</ab>

<fw>Against Moab, Iudah, and
Israel.</fw>
<ab n="11">¶ Thus
saith the Lord, For three transgressions of Edom, and for foure, I
will not turne away the punishment thereof, because he did pursue
his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pitie, and his
anger did teare perpetually, and kept his wrath for
euer.<note> Heb. corrupted his compassions.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">But I will
send a fire vpon Teman, which shall deuoure the palaces of
Bozrah.</ab>
<ab n="13">¶ Thus
sayth the Lord, For three transgressions of the children of Ammon,
and for foure, I wil not turne away the punishment thereof; because
they haue ript vp the women with childe of Gilead, that they might
enlarge their border.<note> Or, diuided the mountaines.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">But I will
kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall deuoure the
palaces thereof, with showting in the day of battell, with a
tempest in the day of the whirlewinde.</ab>
<ab n="15">And their king
shall goe into captiuitie, hee, and his princes together, sayth the
Lord.</ab>
