<head>CHAP.
XXXII.</head>
<head>1 Sennacherib inuading Iudah,
Hezekiah fortifieth himselfe and encourageth his people. 9 Against
the blasphemies of Sennacherib by message and letters, Hezekiah
&amp; Isaiah pray. 21 An Angel destroyeth the hoste of the
Assyrians, to the glory of Hezekiah. 24 Hezekiah praying in his
sickenes, God giueth him a signe of recouerie. 25 He waxing proud,
is humbled by God. 27 His wealth and works. 31 His errour in the
embassage of Babylon. 32 He dying, Manasseh succeedeth
him.</head>

<ab n="1">After these
things and the establishment therof, Sennacherib king of Assyria
came, and entred into Iudah, &amp; encamped against the fenced
cities, and thought to winne them for himselfe.<note> 2.king.18 13,&amp;c. esai. 36.1,&amp;c. , Hebr. to breake them vp.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And when
Hezekiah sawe that Sennacherib was come, and that hee was purposed
to fight against Ierusalem,<note> Heb. his face was to warre.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">He tooke
counsel with his princes, and his mightie men, to stop the waters
of the fountaines, which were without the citie: and they did helpe
him.</ab>
<ab n="4">So there was
gathered much people together, who stopt all the fountaines, and
the brooke that ranne through the midst of the land, saying, Why
should the kings of Assyria come, and finde much water?<note> Heb. ouerflowed.</note></ab>

<fw>Sennacheribs blasphemie.</fw>
<ab n="5">Also he
strengthened himselfe, and built vp all the wall that was broken,
and raised it vp to the towers, and another wall without, and
prepared Millo in the citie of Dauid, and made darts and shields in
abundance.<note> Or, swords, or weapons.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">And hee set
captaines of warre ouer the people, and gathered them together to
him in the streete of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably
to them, saying;<note> Heb. hee spake to their heart.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">Be strong
and couragious, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria,
nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there bee moe with
vs, then with him.</ab>
<ab n="8">With him is
an arme of flesh, but with vs is the Lord our God to helpe vs, and
to fight our battels. And the people rested themselues vpon the
words of Hezekiah king of Iudah.<note> Iere.17.5. , Heb. leaned.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">¶ After
this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his seruants to Ierusalem
(but he himselfe laide siege against Lachish, and all his power
with him) vnto Hezekiah king of Iudah, and vnto all Iudah that were
at Ierusalem, saying;<note> 2.King. 18.17. , Heb. dominion.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">Thus sayth
Semacherib king of Assyria, Whereon doe ye trust, that yee abide in
the siege in Ierusalem?<note> Or, in the strong hold.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">Doeth not
Hezekiah perswade you to giue ouer your selues to die by famine and
by thirst, saying, The Lord our God shall deliuer vs out of the
hand of the king of Assyria?</ab>
<ab n="12">Hath not
the same Hezekiah taken away his high places, and his altars, and
commanded Iudah and Ierusalem, saying; Yee shall worship before one
altar, &amp; burne incense vpon it?</ab>
<ab n="13">Know ye not
what I and my fathers haue done vnto all the people of other lands?
were the gods of the nations of those landes any wayes able to
deliuer their lands out of mine hand?</ab>
<ab n="14">Who was
there among all the gods of those nations, that my fathers vtterly
destroyed, that could deliuer his people out of mine hand, that
your God should bee able to deliuer you out of mine hand?</ab>
<ab n="15">Now
therefore let not Hezekiah deceiue you, nor perswade you on this
manner, neither yet beleeue him: for no god of any nation or
kingdome was able to deliuer his people out of mine hand, &amp; out
of the hand of my fathers: how much lesse shall your God deliuer
you out of mine hand?</ab>

<fw>Sennacheribs blasphemie.</fw>
<ab n="16">And his
seruants spake yet more against the Lord God, and against his
seruant Hezekiah.</ab>
<ab n="17">Hee wrote
also letters to raile on the Lord God of Israel, &amp; to speake
against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands haue
not deliuered their people out of mine hand: so shall not the God
of Hezekiah deliuer his people out of mine hand.</ab>
<ab n="18">Then they
cryed with a loude voice in the Iewes speech vnto the people of
Ierusalem that were on the wal, to affright them, and to trouble
them, that they might take the city.</ab>
<ab n="19">And they
spake against the God of Ierusalem, as against the gods of the
people of the earth which were the worke of the hands of
man.</ab>
<ab n="20">For this
cause Hezekiah the king, and the Prophet Isaiah the sonne of Amoz,
prayed and cryed to heauen.</ab>
<ab n="21">¶ And
the Lord sent an Angel, which cut off all the mightie men of
valour, and the leaders and captains in the campe of the king of
Assyria: so hee returned with shame of face to his owne land. And
when hee was come into the house of his god, they that came foorth
of his owne bowels, slew him there with the sword.<note> 2.King.19.35,&amp;c. , Heb. made him fall.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">Thus the
Lord saued Hezekiah, and the inhabitants of Ierusalem, from the
hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all
other, and guided them on euery side.</ab>
<ab n="23">And many
brought gifts vnto the Lord to Ierusalem, and presents to Hezekiah
king of Iudah: so that hee was magnified in the sight of all
nations, from thenceforth.<note> Heb. pretious things.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">¶ In
those dayes Hezekiah was sicke to the death, and prayed vnto the
Lord: and he spake vnto him, and he gaue him a signe.<note> 2.King.20. 1.isai.38.1. , Or, wroght a miracle for him.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">But
Hezekiah rendred not againe, according to the benefit done vnto
him: for his heart was lifted vp, therefore there was wrath vpon
him, and vpon Iudah and Ierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="26">Notwithstanding,
Hezekiah humbled himselfe for the pride of his heart, (both hee and
the inhabitants of Ierusalem) so that the wrath of the Lord came
not vpon them in the dayes of Hezekiah.<note> Heb. the lifting vp.</note></ab>

<fw>Hezekiah dieth:</fw>
<ab n="27">¶ And
Hezekiah had exceeding much riches, and honour: and he made
himselfe treasuries for siluer, and for golde, and for precious
stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all maner of
pleasant iewels;<note> Hebr. instruments of desire.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">Store-houses
also for the increase of corne, and wine and oile; and stalles for
all maner of beasts, and coates for flocks.</ab>
<ab n="29">Moreouer,
hee prouided him cities, and possessions of flockes &amp; heards in
abundance: for God had giuen him substance very much.</ab>
<ab n="30">This same
Hezekiah also stopped the vpper water-course of Gihon, and brought
it straight downe to the Westside of the City of Dauid. And
Hezekiah prospered in all his workes.</ab>
<ab n="31">¶
Howbeit, in the businesse of the Embassadours of the Princes of
Babylon, who sent vnto him to enquire of the wonder that was done
in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that
was in his heart.<note> Heb. interpreters. , 2.King. 20.12. isa. 39.1.</note></ab>
<ab n="32">¶ Now,
the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodnesse, behold, they
are written in the vision of Isaiah the Prophet, the sonne of Amoz,
and in the booke of the kings of Iudah and Israel.<note> Hebr. kindnesses.</note></ab>
<ab n="33">And
Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
chiefest of the Sepulchres of the sonnes of Dauid: and all Iudah
and the inhabitants of Ierusalem did him honour at his death: and
Manasseh his sonne reigned in his stead.<note> Or, highest.</note></ab>
