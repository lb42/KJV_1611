<ab n="1">He that
reuengeth shall find vengeance from the Lord, and he will surely
keepe his sinnes (in remembrance.)</ab>
<ab n="2">Forgiue
thy neighbour the hurt that he hath done vnto thee, so shall thy
sinnes also be forgiuen when thou prayest.</ab>
<ab n="3">One man
beareth hatred against another, and doeth he seeke pardon from the
Lord?</ab>
<ab n="4">Hee
sheweth no mercy to a man, which is like himselfe: and doeth hee
aske forgiuenesse of his owne sinnes?</ab>
<ab n="5">If he that
is but flesh nourish hatred, who will intreat for pardon of his
sinnes?</ab>
<ab n="6">Remember
thy end, and let enimitie cease, [remember] corruption and death,
and abide in the Commandements.</ab>
<ab n="7">Remember
the Commaundements, &amp; beare no malice to thy neighbour:
[remember] the Couenant of the highest, and winke at
ignorance.</ab>
<ab n="8">Abstaine
from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sinnes: for a furious man
will kindle strife.<note> Chap.8.1.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">A sinfull
man disquieteth friends, and maketh debate among them that be at
peace.</ab>
<ab n="10">As the
matter of the fire is, so it burneth: and as a mans strength is, so
is his wrath, and according to his riches his anger riseth, and the
stronger they are which contend, the more they will be
inflamed.<note> Prou.26. 21.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">An hastie
contention kindleth a fire, and an hasty fighting sheddeth
blood.</ab>
<ab n="12">If thou
blow the sparke, it shall burne: if thou spit vpon it, it shall bee
quenched, and both these come out of thy mouth.</ab>
<ab n="13">Curse the
whisperer, and double tongued: for such haue destroyed many that
were at peace.<note> Chap. 21. 28.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">A
backbiting tongue hath disquieted many, and driuen them from nation
to nation, strong cities hath it pulled down, and ouerthrowen the
houses of great men.</ab>
<ab n="15">A
backbiting tongue hath cast out vertuous women, and depriued them
of their labours.<note> Or, third.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">Who so
hearkeneth vnto it, shall neuer finde rest, and neuer dwel
quietly.</ab>
<ab n="17">The
stroke of the whip maketh markes in the flesh, but the stroke of
the tongue breaketh the bones.</ab>
<ab n="18">Many haue
fallen by the edge of the sword: but not so many as haue fallen by
the tongue.</ab>
<ab n="19">Well is
hee that is defended from it, and hath not passed through the
venime thereof: who hath not drawen the yoke thereof, nor hath bene
bound in her bands.</ab>
<ab n="20">For the
yoke thereof is a yoke of yron, and the bands thereof are bandes of
brasse.</ab>
<ab n="21">The death
therof is an euil death, the graue were better then it.</ab>
<ab n="22">It shall
not haue rule ouer them that feare God, neither shall they be burnt
with the flame thereof.</ab>
<ab n="23">Such as
forsake the Lord shall fall into it, and it shall burne in them,
and not be quenched, it shalbe sent vpon them as a Lion, and
deuoure them as a Leopard.</ab>
<ab n="24">Looke
that thou hedge thy possession about with thornes, and binde vp thy
siluer and gold:</ab>
<ab n="25">And weigh
thy words in a ballance, and make a doore and barre for thy
mouth.</ab>
<ab n="26">Beware
thou slide not by it, lest thou fall before him that lieth in
wait.</ab>
