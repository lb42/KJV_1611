<head>CHAP. VI.</head>
<head>1 The Church professeth her faith in
Christ. 4 Christ sheweth the graces of the Church, 10 and his loue
towards her.</head>


<fw>The beautie of the church.</fw>
<ab n="1">Whither is
thy beloued gone? O thou fairest among women, whither is thy
beloued turned aside? that we may seeke him with thee.</ab>
<ab n="2">My beloued
is gone downe into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feede in
the gardens, and to gather lillies.</ab>
<ab n="3">I am my
beloueds, &amp; my beloued is mine: he feedeth among the
lillies.<note> Chap.2. 16. and 7. 10.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">¶
Thou art beautifull, O my loue, as Tirzah, comely as Ierusalem,
terrible as an armie with banners.</ab>
<ab n="5">Turne away
thine eyes from me, for they haue ouercome me: thy haire is a
flocke of goates, that appeare from Gilead.<note> Or, they haue puffed me vp. , Chap. 4. 1. and 2.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">Thy teeth
are as a flocke of sheepe which goe vp from the washing, wherof
euery one beareth twinnes, and there is not one barren among
them.</ab>
<ab n="7">As a piece
of a pomegranat are thy temples within thy lockes.</ab>
<ab n="8">There are
threescore Queenes, and fourescore concubines, and virgins without
number.</ab>
<ab n="9">My doue,
my vndefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is
the choice one of her that bare her: The daughters sawe her, and
blessed her; yea the Queenes and the concubins, and they praysed
her.</ab>
<ab n="10">¶
Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, faire as the moone,
cleare as the sunne, and terrible as an armie with banners?</ab>
<ab n="11">I went
downe into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and
to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranats
budded.</ab>
<ab n="12">Or euer I
was aware, my soule made me like the chariots of
Amminadib.<note> Heb. I knew not. , Or, set me on the chariot of my willing people.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Returne,
returne, O Shulamite; returne, returne, that we may looke vpon
thee: what will yee see in the Shulamite? as it were the company of
two armies.<note> Or of Mahanaim.</note></ab>
