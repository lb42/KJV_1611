<ab n="1">And the Lord sayd
vnto Aaron, Thou and thy sonnes, and thy fathers house with thee,
shall beare the iniquitie of the Sanctuary: and thou and thy sonnes
with thee, shall beare the iniquitie of your Priesthood.</ab>
<ab n="2">And thy brethren
also of the tribe of Leui, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with
thee, that they may be ioyned vnto thee, and minister vnto thee:
but thou and thy sonnes with thee shall minister before the
Tabernacle of Witnesse.</ab>
<ab n="3">And they shall
keepe thy charge, and the charge of all the Tabernacle: onely they
shall not come nigh the vessels of the Sanctuarie, and the Altar,
that neither they, nor you also die.</ab>
<ab n="4">And they shall
bee ioyned vnto thee, and keepe the charge of the Tabernacle of the
Congregation, for all the seruice of the Tabernacle: and a stranger
shall not come nigh vnto you.</ab>
<ab n="5">And yee shall
keepe the charge of the Sanctuary, and the charge of the Altar,
that there be no wrath any more vpon the children of
Israel.</ab>
<ab n="6">And I, beholde, I
haue taken your brethren the Leuites from among the children of
Israel: to you they are giuen as a gift for the Lord, to doe the
seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.<note> Chap.3. 45.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">Therefore thou
and thy sonnes with thee, shall keepe your Priests office for euery
thing of the Altar, and within the Uaile, and yee shall serue: I
haue giuen your Priests office vnto you, as a seruice of gift: and
the stranger that commeth nigh, shall bee put to death.</ab>

<fw>The Priests charge, and
portion.</fw>
<ab n="8">¶ And the
Lord spake vnto Aaron, Behold, I also haue giuen thee the charge of
mine heaue offerings, of all the hallowed things of the children of
Israel, vnto thee haue I giuen them by reason of the anointing, and
to thy sonnes by an ordinance for euer.</ab>
<ab n="9">This shall bee
thine of the most holy things, reserued from the fire: euery
oblation of theirs, euery meat offering of theirs, and euery sinne
offering of theirs, and euery trespasse offering of theirs, which
they shal render vnto me, shall be most holy for thee, and for thy
sonnes.</ab>
<ab n="10">In the most holy
place shalt thou eate it, euery male shall eate it: it shall be
holy vnto thee.</ab>
<ab n="11">And this is
thine: the heaue offering of their gift, with all the waue offrings
of the children of Israel: I haue giuen them vnto thee, &amp; to
thy sonnes, and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for euer:
euery one that is cleane in thy house, shall eate of
it.<note> Leuit. 10 14.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">All the best of
the oyle, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the first
fruits of them which they shall offer vnto the Lord, them haue I
giuen thee.<note> Heb. fat.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">And whatsoeuer
is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring vnto the Lord,
shall be thine, euery one that is cleane in thine house, shall eat
of it.</ab>
<ab n="14">Euery thing
deuoted in Israel, shall be thine.<note> Leuit. 27. 28.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">Euery thing that
openeth the matrice in all flesh, which they bring vnto the Lord,
whether it bee of men or beasts, shall be thine: Neuertheles the
first borne of man shalt thou surely redeeme, and the firstling of
vncleane beasts shalt thou redeeme.<note> Exod.13. 2. &amp; 22.29. leuit.27.26 chap. 3. 13.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">And those that
are to be redeemed, from a moneth old shalt thou redeeme according
to thine estimation, for the money of fiue shekels, after the
shekel of the Sanctuary, which is twentie gerahs.<note> Exod.30. 13. leuit.27 25.chap. 3. 47. ezek.45 12.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">But the
firstling of a cowe, or the firstling of a sheepe, or the firstling
of a goat thou shalt not redeeme, they are holy: thou shalt
sprinckle their blood vpon the Altar, and shalt burne their fat for
an offering made by fire, for a sweet sauour vnto the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="18">And the flesh of
them shall bee thine: as the waue breast, and as the right shoulder
are thine.<note> Exod. 29. 26.</note></ab>

<fw>The tythes giuen to the
Leuites.</fw>
<ab n="19">All the heaue
offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer
vnto the Lord, haue I giuen thee and thy sonnes, and thy daughters
with thee, by a statute for euer: it is a couenant of salt for
euer, before the Lord vnto thee, and to thy seed with thee.</ab>
<ab n="20">¶ And the
Lord spake vnto Aaron, Thou shalt haue no inheritance in their
land, neither shalt thou haue any part among them: I am thy part,
and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.<note> Deut. 10. 9.and 18.2. iosh. 13. 14. 33. ezech.44. 28.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">And behold, I
haue giuen the children of Leui all the tenth in Israel, for an
inheritance, for their seruice which they serue, euen the seruice
of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.</ab>
<ab n="22">Neither must the
children of Israel hencefoorth come nigh the Tabernacle of the
Congregation, lest they beare sinne, and die.<note> Hebr. to die.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">But the Leuites
shall doe the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and
they shal beare their iniquitie: it shall be a statute for euer
throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they
haue no inheritance.</ab>
<ab n="24">But the tithes
of the children of Israel which they offer as an heaue offering
vnto the Lord, I haue giuen to the Leuites to inherite: therefore I
haue said vnto them, Among the children of Israel they shall haue
no inheritance.</ab>
<ab n="25">¶ And the
Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,</ab>
<ab n="26">Thus speake vnto
the Leuites, and say vnto them, When ye take of the children of
Israel the tithes, which I haue giuen you from them for your
inheritance, then ye shal offer vp an heaue offering of it for the
Lord, euen a tenth part of the tithe.</ab>
<ab n="27">And this your
heaue offering shall be reckoned vnto you, as though it were the
corne of the threshing floore, and as the fulnesse of the wine
presse.</ab>
<ab n="28">Thus you also
shal offer an heaue offering vnto the Lord of all your tithes which
ye receiue of the children of Israel, and ye shall giue thereof the
Lords heaue offering to Aaron the Priest.</ab>

<fw>The tythes giuen to the
Leuites.</fw>
<ab n="29">Out of all your
gifts ye shall offer euery heaue offering of the Lord, of all the
best thereof, euen the hallowed part thereof, out of
it.<note> Hebr. fat.</note></ab>
<ab n="30">Therefore thou
shalt say vnto them, When yee haue heaued the best thereof from it,
then it shall be counted vnto the Leuites, as the encrease of the
threshing floore, and as the encrease of the wine presse.</ab>
<ab n="31">And ye shall
eate it in euery place, ye and your housholds: for it is your
reward for your seruice, in the Tabernacle of the
Congregation.</ab>
<ab n="32">And yee shall
beare no sinne by reason of it, when ye haue heaued from it the
best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the
children of Israel, lest ye die.</ab>
