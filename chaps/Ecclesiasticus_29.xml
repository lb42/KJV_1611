<head>CHAP.
XXIX.</head>
<head>2. Wee must shew mercy and lend: 4
but the borower must not defraud the lender. 9 Giue almes. 14 A
good man will not vndoe his suretie. 18 To be suretie and vndertake
for others is dangerous. 22 It is better to liue at home, then to
soiourne.</head>

<ab n="1">Hee that
is mercifull, will lende vnto his neighbour, and hee that
strengthneth his hande, keepeth the Commandements.</ab>
<ab n="2">Lend to
thy neighbour in time of his need, and pay thou thy neighbour
againe in due season.<note> Deut. 15. 8. matth.5. 42. luke 6. 35.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">Keepe thy
word &amp; deale faithfully with him, and thou shalt alwaies finde
the thing that is necessary for thee.</ab>
<ab n="4">Many when
a thing was lent them, reckoned it to be found, and put them to
trouble that helped them.</ab>
<ab n="5">Till he
hath receiued, he will kisse a mans hand: and for his neighbours
money he will speake submissely: but when he should repay, he will
prolong the time, and returne words of griefe, and complaine of the
time.</ab>
<ab n="6">If he
preuaile, he shall hardly receiue the halfe, and he will count as
if he had found it: if not; he hath depriued him of his money, and
he hath gotten him an enemy without cause: he payeth him with
cursings, and raylings: and for honour he will pay him
disgrace.<note> Or, if he be able.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">Many
therefore haue refused to lend for other mens ill dealing, fearing
to be defrauded.</ab>
<ab n="8">Yet haue
thou patience with a man in poore estate, and delay not to shew him
mercy.</ab>
<ab n="9">Helpe the
poore for the commandements sake, and turne him not away because of
his pouertie.</ab>
<ab n="10">Lose thy
money for thy brother and thy friend, and let it not rust vnder a
stone to be lost.</ab>
<ab n="11">Lay vp
thy treasure according to the commandements of the most high, and
it shall bring thee more profite then golde.<note> Dan.4.24 matt. 6.20. luke 11.41. and 12. 33. acts 10.4. 1.tim.6 18,19. Iob 4 8, 9,10.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">Shut vp
almes in thy storehouses: and it shall deliuer thee from all
affliction.<note> Dan.4.24 matt. 6.20. luke 11.41. and 12. 33. acts 10.4. 1.tim.6 18,19. Iob 4 8, 9,10.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">It shal
fight for thee against thine enemies, better then a mightie shield
and strong speare.</ab>
<ab n="14">An honest
man is suretie for his neighbour: but hee that is impudent, will
forsake him.<note> Or, faile.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">Forget
not the friendship of thy suretie: for hee hath giuen his life for
thee.</ab>
<ab n="16">A sinner
will ouerthrow the good estate of his suretie:</ab>
<ab n="17">And he
that is of an vnthankfull minde, will leaue him in [danger] that
deliuered him.</ab>
<ab n="18">Suretiship
hath vndone many of good estate, and shaked them as a waue of the
Sea: mightie men hath it driuen from their houses, so that they
wandred among strange nations.</ab>
<ab n="19">A wicked
man transgressing the commandements of the Lord, shall fall into
suretiship: and hee that vndertaketh and followeth other mens
businesse for gaine, shall fall into suits.</ab>
<ab n="20">Helpe thy
neighbour according to thy power, and beware that thou thy selfe
fall not into the same.</ab>
<ab n="21">The
chiefe thing for life is water and bread, and clothing, and an
house to couer shame.<note> Chap.39. 26.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">Better is
the life of a poore man in a meane cottage, then delicate fare in
another mans house.</ab>
<ab n="23">Be it
little or much, holde thee contented, that thou heare not the
reproch of thy house.</ab>
<ab n="24">For it is
a miserable life to goe from house to house: for where thou art a
stranger, thou darest not open thy mouth.</ab>
<ab n="25">Thou
shalt entertaine and feast, and haue no thankes: moreouer, thou
shalt heare bitter words.</ab>
<ab n="26">Come thou
stranger, and furnish a table, and feede me of that thou hast
ready.</ab>
<ab n="27">Giue
place thou stranger to an honourable man, my brother commeth to be
lodged, and I haue neede of mine house.</ab>
<ab n="28">These
things are grieuous to a man of vnderstanding: the vpbraiding of
house-roome, and reproching of the lender.</ab>
