<fw>Iehoram King.</fw>
<ab n="1">Now Iehoram the
sonne of Ahab began to reigne ouer Israel in Samaria, the
eighteenth yere of Iehoshaphat king of Iudah, and reigned twelue
yeeres.</ab>
<ab n="2">And he wrought
euill in the sight of the Lord, but not like his father and like
his mother; for hee put away the image of Baal that his father had
made.<note> Hebr. statue.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">Neuerthelesse, hee
cleaued vnto the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, which made
Israel to sinne; he departed not therefrom.</ab>
<ab n="4">¶ And Mesha
king of Moab was a sheepe-master, and rendred vnto the king of
Israel an hundred thousand lambes, and an hundred thousand rammes,
with the wooll.</ab>
<ab n="5">But it came to
passe when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against
the king of Israel.<note> Chap.1. 1.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">¶ And king
Iehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbred all
Israel.</ab>
<ab n="7">And he went, and
sent to Iehoshaphat the King of Iudah, saying, The king of Moab
hath rebelled against mee: Wilt thou goe with mee against Moab to
battell? and he said, I will goe vp: I am as thou art, my people as
thy people, and my horses as thy horses.<note> 1.King. 22.4.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">And he said, Which
way shall we goe vp? And he answered, The way through the
wildernesse of Edom.</ab>
<ab n="9">So the king of
Israel went, and the king of Iudah, and the king of Edom: and they
fetcht a compasse of seuen dayes iourney: and there was no water
for the hoste, and for the cattell that followed them.<note> Hebr. at their feet.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">And the king of
Israel said, Alas, that the Lord hath called these three kings
together, to deliuer them into the hand of Moab.</ab>
<ab n="11">But Iehoshaphat
said, Is there not here a Prophet of the Lord, that we may enquire
of the Lord by him? And one of the king of Israels seruants
answered, and said, Here is Elisha the sonne of Shaphat, which
powred water on the hands of Eliiah.</ab>
<ab n="12">And Iehoshaphat
saide, The word of the Lord is with him. So the king of Israel,
&amp; Iehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went downe to him.</ab>

<fw>The Moabites are ouercome.</fw>
<ab n="13">And Elisha saide
vnto the king of Israel, What haue I to doe with thee? Get thee to
the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And
the king of Israel said vnto him, Nay: for the Lord hath called
these three kings together, to deliuer them into the hand of
Moab.</ab>
<ab n="14">And Elisha said,
As the Lord of hostes liueth, before whom I stand, Surely were it
not that I regard the presence of Iehoshaphat the King of Iudah, I
would not looke toward thee, nor see thee.</ab>
<ab n="15">But now bring me
a minstrell. And it came to passe when the minstrell played, that
the hand of the Lord came vpon him.</ab>
<ab n="16">And hee sayde,
Thus sayth the Lord, Make this valley full of ditches.</ab>
<ab n="17">For thus sayth
the Lord, Yee shall not see winde, neither shall ye see raine, yet
that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drinke, both
ye, and your cattell, and your beasts.</ab>
<ab n="18">And this is but a
light thing in the sight of the Lord, he will deliuer the Moabites
also into your hand.</ab>
<ab n="19">And ye shall
smite euery fenced citie, and euery choice citie, and shall fell
euery good tree, and stop all welles of water, and marre euery good
piece of land with stones.<note> Heb. grieue</note></ab>
<ab n="20">And it came to
passe in the morning when the meate offering was offered, that
behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the countrey was
filled with water.</ab>
<ab n="21">¶ And when
all the Moabites heard that the kings were come vp to fight against
them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and
vpward, and stood in the border.<note> Heb. were cryed together. , Heb. gird himselfe with a girdle.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">And they rose vp
early in the morning, and the Sunne shone vpon the water, and the
Moabites sawe the water on the other side as red as blood.</ab>
<ab n="23">And they said,
This is blood: the kings are surely slaine, and they haue smitten
one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoile.<note> Heb. destroyed.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">And when they
came to the campe of Israel, the Israelites rose vp and smote the
Moabites, so that they fledde before them: but they went forward
smiting the Moabites, euen in their countrey.<note> Or, they smote in it, euen smiting.</note></ab>

<fw>The Moabites are ouercome.</fw>
<ab n="25">And they beat
downe the cities, and on euery good piece of land cast euery man
his stone, and filled it, and they stopped all the welles of water,
and felled all the good trees: onely in Kirharaseth left they the
stones thereof: howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote
it.<note> Heb. vntill he left the stones thereof in Kirharaseth.</note></ab>
<ab n="26">¶ And when
the king of Moab sawe that the battell was too sore for him, he
tooke with him seuen hundred men that drewe swordes, to breake
thorow euen vnto the king of Edom: but they could not.</ab>
<ab n="27">Then hee tooke
his eldest sonne that should haue reigned in his stead, and offered
him for a burnt offering vpon the wall: and there was great
indignation against Israel, and they departed from him, and
returned to their owne land.</ab>
