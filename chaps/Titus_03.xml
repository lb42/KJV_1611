<head>CHAP.
III.</head>
<head>1 Titus is yet further directed by
Paul, both concerning the things he should teach, and not teach. 10
He is willed also to reiect obstinate Heretikes: 12 which done, hee
appointeth him both time and place, wherein hee should come vnto
him, &amp; so concludeth.</head>

<ab n="1">Put them in
minde to bee subiect to Principalities &amp; Powers, to obey
magistrates, to be ready to euery good worke,</ab>
<ab n="2">To speake
euill of no man, to bee no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all
meekenesse vnto all men.</ab>
<ab n="3">For we our
selues also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceiued, seruing
diuers lusts and pleasures, liuing in malice and enuy, hatefull,
and hating one another.</ab>
<ab n="4">But after that
the kindnesse and loue of God our Sauiour toward man
appeared,<note> Or, pitie.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">Not by workes
of righteousnesse which wee haue done, but according to his mercy
he saued vs, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the
holy Ghost,</ab>
<ab n="6">Which hee shed
on vs abundantly, through Iesus Christ our Sauiour:<note> Gr. richly.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">That being
iustified by his grace, we should bee made heires according to the
hope of eternall life.</ab>
<ab n="8">This is a
faithfull saying, and these things I will that thou affirme
constantly, that they which haue beleeued in God, might be carefull
to maintaine good works: these things are good and profitable vnto
men.</ab>
<ab n="9">But auoyd
foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and striuings
about the lawe; for they are vnprofitable and vaine.</ab>

<fw>Pauls request for Onesimus.</fw>
<ab n="10">A man that is an
heretike, after the first and second admonition, reiect:</ab>
<ab n="11">Knowing that hee
that is such, is subuerted, and sinneth, being condemned of
himselfe.</ab>
<ab n="12">When I shall send
Artemas vnto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come vnto mee to
Nicopolis: for I haue determined there to winter.</ab>
<ab n="13">Bring Zenas the
Lawyer, and Apollos, on their iourney diligently, that nothing be
wanting vnto them.</ab>
<ab n="14">And let ours also
learne to maintaine good workes for necessarie vses, that they be
not vnfruitfull.<note> Or, professe honest trades</note></ab>
<ab n="15">All that are with
mee salute thee. Greete them that loue vs in the faith. Grace be
with you all. Amen. [It was written to Titus ordeined the first
Bishop of the Church of the Cretians, from Nicopolis of
Macedonia.]</ab>
