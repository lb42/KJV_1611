<head>CHAP. IV.</head>
<head>1 Wee are to striue against
couetousnesse, 4 intemperance, 5 pride, 11 detraction, and rash
iudgement of others: 13 and not to bee confident in the good
successe of worldly businesse, but mindfull euer of the
vncertaintie of this life, to commit our selues, and all our
affaires to Gods prouidence.</head>

<ab n="1">From whence
come warres and fightings among you? come they not hence, euen of
your lusts, that warre in your members?<note> Or, brawlings. , Or, pleasures.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">Ye lust, and
haue not: yee kill, and desire to haue, and cannot obtaine: yee
fight and warre, yet yee haue not, because ye aske not.</ab>
<ab n="3">Ye aske and
receiue not, because ye aske amisse, that yee may consume it vpon
your lusts.<note> Or, pleasures.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">Ye adulterers,
and adulteresses, know yee not that the friendship of the world is
enmity with God? whosoeuer therefore will be a friend of the world,
is the enemy of God.</ab>
<ab n="5">Doe ye thinke
that the Scripture saith in vaine, the spirit that dwelleth in vs
lusteth to enuy?<note> Or, enuiously.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">But he giueth
more grace, wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proude, but
giueth grace vnto the humble.<note> Pro.3.34. 1.pet.5.5.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">Submit your
selues therefore to God: resist the deuill, and hee will flee from
you.</ab>
<ab n="8">Draw nigh to
God, and hee will draw nigh to you: cleanse your hands ye sinners,
and purifie your hearts yee double minded.</ab>
<ab n="9">Bee afflicted,
and mourne, and weepe: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and
your ioy to heauinesse.</ab>
<ab n="10">Humble your selues
in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you vp.</ab>

<fw>Euill reioycing.</fw>
<ab n="11">Speake not euill
one of another (brethren:) he that speaketh euill of his brother,
and iudgeth his brother, speaketh euill of the Law, and iudgeth the
Law: but if thou iudge the Law, thou art not a doer of the Law, but
a iudge.</ab>
<ab n="12">There is one
Lawgiuer, who is able to saue, and to destroy: who art thou that
iudgest another?</ab>
<ab n="13">Goe to now ye that
say, To day or to morrow wee will goe into such a city and continue
there a yere, and buy, and sell, and get gaine:</ab>
<ab n="14">Whereas yee know
not what shalbe on the morow: for what is your life? It is euen a
vapour that appeareth for a litle time, and then vanisheth
away.<note> Pro.27.1. , Or, for it is.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">For that yee ought
to say, if the Lord will, we shall liue, and doe this, or
that.</ab>
<ab n="16">But now yee reioyce
in your boastings: all such reioycing is euill.</ab>
<ab n="17">Therefore to him
that knoweth to doe good, and doth it not, to him it is
sinne.</ab>
