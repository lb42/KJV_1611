<head>CHAP. VI.</head>
<head>1 Elisha giuing leaue to the yong
Prophets to inlarge their dwellings, causeth yron to swim. 8 Hee
discloseth the king of Syria his counsell. 13 The armie which was
sent to Dothan to apprehend Elisha, is smitten with blindnesse: 19
Being brought into Samaria, they are dismissed in peace. 24 The
famine in Samaria, causeth women to eate their owne children. 30
The king sendeth to slay Elisha.</head>

<ab n="1">And the sonnes of
the Prophets saide vnto Elisha, Beholde now, the place where wee
dwell with thee, is too strait for vs:</ab>
<ab n="2">Let vs goe, wee
pray thee, vnto Iordane, and take thence euery man a beame, and let
vs make vs a place there where we may dwell. And hee answered, Goe
ye.</ab>
<ab n="3">And one said, Be
content, I pray thee, and goe with thy seruants. And he answered, I
will goe.</ab>

<fw>Iron swimmeth.</fw>
<ab n="4">So hee went with
them: and when they came to Iordane, they cut downe wood.</ab>
<ab n="5">But as one was
felling a beame, the axe head fell into the water: and hee cryed,
and sayd, Alas master, for it was borrowed.<note> Heb. yron.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">And the man of God
said, Where fell it? and hee shewed him the place: and he cut downe
a sticke, and cast it in thither, and the yron did swimme.</ab>
<ab n="7">Therefore said he,
Take it vp to thee: And hee put out his hand, and tooke it.</ab>
<ab n="8">¶ Then the
king of Syria warred against Israel, and tooke counsell with his
seruants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my
campe.<note> Or, encamping.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And the man of God
sent vnto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou passe not
such a place; for thither the Syrians are come downe.</ab>
<ab n="10">And the king of
Israel sent to the place which the man of God tolde him, and warned
him of, and saued himselfe there, not once nor twise.</ab>
<ab n="11">Therefore the
heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing, and he
called his seruants, and said vnto them, Will ye not shewe me which
of vs is for the king of Israel?</ab>
<ab n="12">And one of his
seruants sayde, None, my lord O king; but Elisha the Prophet, that
is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel, the wordes that thou
speakest in thy bed-chamber.<note> Heb. No.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">¶ And he
said, Goe and spie where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And
it was tolde him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.</ab>
<ab n="14">Therefore sent he
thither horses, and charets, and a great hoste: and they came by
night, and compassed the citie about.<note> Heb. heauie.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">And when the
seruant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth, behold,
an host compassed the citie, both with horses and charets: and his
seruant said vnto him, Alas my master, how shall we
doe?<note> Or, minister.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">And he answered,
Feare not: for they that be with vs, are moe then they that be with
them.<note> 2. Chron. 32.7.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">And Elisha
prayed, and sayde, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes that he may
see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and hee saw:
and behold, the mountaine was full of horses, and charets of fire
round about Elisha.</ab>

<fw>A great famine.</fw>
<ab n="18">And when they
came downe to him, Elisha prayed vnto the Lord, and said, Smite
this people, I pray thee, with blindnesse. And hee smote them with
blindnesse, according to the word of Elisha.</ab>
<ab n="19">¶ And Elisha
saide vnto them, This is not the way, neither is this the citie:
follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seeke. But hee
led them to Samaria.<note> Heb. come ye after me.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">And it came to
passe when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, Lord,
open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the Lord opened
their eyes, and they saw, and beholde, they were in the mids of
Samaria.</ab>
<ab n="21">And the king of
Israel saide vnto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I
smite them? shall I smite them?</ab>
<ab n="22">And he answered,
Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast
taken captiue with thy sword, and with thy bow? set bread and water
before them, that they may eate, and drinke, and go to their
master.</ab>
<ab n="23">And hee prepared
great prouision for them, and when they had eaten and drunke, hee
sent them away, and they went to their master: so the bands of
Syria came no more into the lande of Israel.</ab>
<ab n="24">¶ And it
came to passe after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all
his hoste, and went vp, and besieged Samaria.</ab>
<ab n="25">And there was a
great famine in Samaria: and behold, they besieged it, vntill an
asses head was solde for fourescore pieces of siluer, and the
fourth part of a kab of doues doung for fiue pieces of
siluer.</ab>
<ab n="26">And as the king
of Israel was passing by vpon the wall, there cried a woman vnto
him, saying, Helpe, my lord, O king.</ab>
<ab n="27">And he said, If
the Lord do not helpe thee, whence shall I helpe thee? out of the
barne floore, or out of the wine presse?<note> Or, Let not the Lord saue thee</note></ab>
<ab n="28">And the king said
vnto her, What aileth thee? And shee answered, This woman said vnto
me, Giue thy sonne, that we may eate him to day, and wee will eate
my sonne to morrow.</ab>

<fw>Plenty foretold.</fw>
<ab n="29">So we boyled my
sonne, and did eate him: and I saide vnto her on the next day, Giue
thy sonne, that we may eate him: and she hath hid her
sonne.<note> Deut 28. 53. , Heb. other.</note></ab>
<ab n="30">¶ And it
came to passe when the king heard the words of the woman, that he
rent his clothes, and hee passed by vpon the wall, and the people
looked, and behold, hee had sackcloth within, vpon his
flesh.</ab>
<ab n="31">Then he said, God
doe so, and more also to mee, if the head of Elisha the sonne of
Shaphat, shall stand on him this day.</ab>
<ab n="32">But Elisha sate
in his house (and the elders sate with him) and the king sent a man
from before him: but yer the messenger came to him, hee said to the
Elders, See yee how this sonne of a murderer hath sent to take away
mine head? Looke when the messenger commeth, shut the doore, and
hold him fast at the doore: Is not the sound of his masters feete
behind him?</ab>
<ab n="33">And while hee yet
talked with them, beholde, the messenger came downe vnto him: and
he said, Behold, this euill is of the Lord, what should I waite for
the Lord any longer?</ab>
