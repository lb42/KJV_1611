<head>CHAP.
XVI.</head>
<head>1 Vnder the similitude of a wretched
infant, is shewed the naturall state of Ierusalem. 6 Gods
extraordinarie loue towards her. 15 Her monstrous whoredome. 35 Her
grieuous Iudgement. 44 Her sinne, matching her mother, and
exceeding her sisters, Sodome and Samaria, calleth for Iudgements.
60 Mercy is promised her in the end.</head>

<ab n="1">Againe the worde
of the Lord came vnto me, saying;</ab>
<ab n="2">Son of man, cause
Ierusalem to know her abominations,</ab>

<fw>Ierusalems state.</fw>
<ab n="3">And say, Thus
saith the Lord God vnto Ierusalem; Thy birth and thy natiuitie is
of the land of Canaan, thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an
Hittite.<note> Heb. cutting out, or habitation.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">And as for thy
natiuity in the day thou wast borne, thy nauell was not cut,
neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee: thou wast not
salted at all, nor swadled at all.<note> Or, when I looked vpon thee.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">None eye pitied
thee to doe any of these vnto thee, to haue compassion vpon thee,
but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy
person, in the day that thou wast borne.</ab>
<ab n="6">¶ And when I
passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine owne blood, I said
vnto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Liue: yea I said vnto thee
when thou wast in thy blood, Liue.<note> Or, troden vnder foot.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">I haue caused
thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased
and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: thy
breasts are fashioned, and thine haire is growen, whereas thou wast
naked and bare.<note> Heb. made thee a million. , Heb. ornament of ornaments.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Now when I passed
by thee, and looked vpon thee, behold, thy time was the time of
loue, and I spread my skirt ouer thee, and couered thy nakednesse:
yea, I sware vnto thee, and entred into a couenant with thee, sayth
the Lord God, and thou becamest mine.</ab>
<ab n="9">Then washed I
thee with water: yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee,
and I anointed thee with oyle.<note> Heb. bloods.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">I clothed thee
also with broidred worke, &amp; shod thee with badgers skin, and I
girded thee about with fine linen, and I couered thee with
silke.</ab>
<ab n="11">I decked thee
also with ornaments, and I put bracelets vpon thine hands, and a
chaine on thy necke.</ab>
<ab n="12">And I put a
iewell on thy forehead, and eare-rings in thine eares, and a
beautifull crowne vpon thine head.</ab>
<ab n="13">Thus wast thou
decked with gold and siluer, and thy raiment was of fine linen
&amp; silke, and broidered worke, thou didst eate fine floure and
honie and oyle, and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst
prosper into a kingdome.</ab>
<ab n="14">And thy renowme
went foorth among the heathen for thy beautie: for it was perfect
through my comelinesse which I had put vpon thee, sayth the Lord
God.</ab>

<fw>The vnkindnesse, and idolatrie of
Ierusalem.</fw>
<ab n="15">¶ But thou
diddest trust in thine owne beauty, and playedst the harlot,
because of thy renowne, and powredst out thy fornications on euery
one that passed by; his it was.</ab>
<ab n="16">And of thy
garments thou diddest take, and deckedst thy high places with
diuers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the like things
shall not come, neither shall it be so.</ab>
<ab n="17">Thou hast also
taken thy faire iewels of my gold and of my siluer, which I had
giuen thee, and madest to thy selfe images of men, and diddest
commit whoredome with them,<note> Heb. of a male.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">And tookest thy
broidered garments and coueredst them: and thou hast set mine oyle
and mine incense before them.</ab>
<ab n="19">My meate also
which I gaue thee, fine flowre, and oyle, and honie wherewith I fed
thee, thou hast euen set it before them for a sweete sauour: and
thus it was, saith the Lord God.<note> Heb. a sauour of rest.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">Moreouer thou
hast taken thy sonnes and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne vnto
me, and these hast thou sacrificed vnto them to be deuoured: is
this of thy whoredomes a small matter,<note> Heb. to deuoure.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">That thou hast
slaine my children, and deliuered them to cause them to passe
through the fire for them?</ab>
<ab n="22">And in all thine
abominations and thy whooredomes, thou hast not remembred the dayes
of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in
thy blood.</ab>
<ab n="23">And it came to
passe after all thy wickednesse (woe, woe vnto thee, saith the Lord
God.)</ab>
<ab n="24">That thou hast
also built vnto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an high
place in euery streete.<note> Or, brothell house.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">Thou hast built
thy high place at euery head of the way, and hast made thy beauty
to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feete to euery one that passed
by, and multiplied thy whooredomes.</ab>
<ab n="26">Thou hast also
committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours great of
flesh, &amp; hast increased thy whooredomes, to prouoke me to
anger.</ab>
<ab n="27">Behold
therefore, I haue stretched out my hand ouer thee, and haue
diminished thine ordinarie foode, and deliuered thee vnto the will
of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are
ashamed of thy lewd way.<note> Or, cities.</note></ab>

<fw>The vnkindnesse, and idolatrie of
Ierusalem.</fw>
<ab n="28">Thou hast played
the whoore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast vnsatiable:
yea thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be
satisfied.</ab>
<ab n="29">Thou hast
moreouer multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan vnto
Caldea, and yet thou wast not satisfied heerewith.</ab>
<ab n="30">How weake is
thine heart, saith the Lord God, seeing thou doest all these
things, the work of an imperious whorish woman?</ab>
<ab n="31">In that thou
buildest thine eminent place in the head of euery way, and makest
thine high place in euery streete, and hast not beene as an harlot,
in that thou scornest hire:<note> Or, in thy daughters is thine &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="32">But as a wife
that committeth adulterie, which taketh strangers in steede of her
husband.</ab>
<ab n="33">They giue gifts
to all whores, but thou giuest thy gifts to all thy louers, and
hyrest them, that they may come vnto thee on euery side for thy
whoredome.<note> Heb. bribest.</note></ab>
<ab n="34">And the contrary
is in thee from other women in thy whoredomes, whereas none
followeth thee to commit whoredomes: and in that thou giuest a
reward, and no reward is giuen vnto thee: therefore thou art
contrary.</ab>
<ab n="35">¶
Wherefore, O harlot, heare the word of the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="36">Thus saith the
Lord God; Because thy filthinesse was powred out, and thy
nakednesse discouered through thy whoredomes with thy louers, and
with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy
children, which thou diddest giue vnto them,</ab>
<ab n="37">Behold
therefore, I will gather all thy louers, with whom thou hast taken
pleasure, and all them that thou hast loued, with all them that
thou hast hated: I will euen gather them round about against thee,
and will discouer thy nakednesse vnto them, that they may see all
thy nakednesse.</ab>
<ab n="38">And I will iudge
thee, as women that breake wedlocke and shead blood are iudged, and
I will giue thee blood in fury and iealousie.<note> Heb. with iudgements of.</note></ab>

<fw>The vnkindnesse, and idolatrie of
Ierusalem.</fw>
<ab n="39">And I will also
giue thee into their hand, and they shal throw downe thine eminent
place, and shall breake downe thy high places: they shall strip
thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy faire iewels, and
leaue thee naked and bare.<note> Heb. instruments of thine ornament.</note></ab>
<ab n="40">They shall also
bring vp a companie against thee, and they shall stone thee with
stones, and thrust thee thorough with their swords.</ab>
<ab n="41">And they shall
burne thine houses with fire, and execute iudgements vpon thee in
the sight of many women: and I wil cause thee to cease from playing
the harlot, and thou also shalt giue no hire any more.<note> 2.Kings.25.9. ier. 52 13.</note></ab>
<ab n="42">So will I make
my fury towards thee to rest, and my iealousie shall depart from
thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.</ab>
<ab n="43">Because thou
hast not remembred the dayes of thy youth, but hast fretted mee in
all these things; behold therefore, I also will recompence thy way
vpon thine head, saith the Lord God: and thou shalt not commit this
lewdnesse, aboue all thine abominations.</ab>
<ab n="44">¶ Behold,
euery one that vseth prouerbs, shall vse this prouerbe against
thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.</ab>
<ab n="45">Thou art thy
mothers daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children, and
thou art the sister of thy sisters which lothed their husbands, and
their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an
Amorite.</ab>
<ab n="46">And thine elder
sister is Samaria, she and her daughters, that dwell at thy left
hand: and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy right hand, is
Sodom and her daughters.<note> Heb. lesser then thou.</note></ab>
<ab n="47">Yet hast thou
not walked after their wayes, nor done after their abominations:
but as if that were a very litle thing, thou wast corrupted more
then they in all thy wayes.<note> Or, that was lothed as a small thing.</note></ab>
<ab n="48">As I liue, saith
the Lord God, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her
daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.</ab>
<ab n="49">Behold, this was
the iniquitie of thy sister Sodom; Pride, fulnesse of bread, and
aboundance of idlenesse was in her and in her daughters, neither
did she strengthen the hand of the poore and needy.</ab>
<ab n="50">And they were
hautie, and committed abomination before me: therefore I tooke them
away, as I saw good.<note> Gen.19.24.</note></ab>

<fw>Her iudgment.</fw>
<ab n="51">Neither hath
Samaria committed halfe of thy sinnes, but thou hast multiplied
thine abominations more then they, and hast iustified thy sisters
in all thine abominations, which thou hast done.</ab>
<ab n="52">Thou also which
hast iudged thy sisters, beare thine owne shame for thy sinnes,
that thou hast committed more abominable then they: they are more
righteous then thou: yea be thou confounded also, and beare thy
shame, in that thou hast iustified thy sisters.</ab>
<ab n="53">When I shall
bring againe their captiuitie, the captiuitie of Sodom and her
daughters, and the captiuitie of Samaria and her daughters, then
will I bring againe the captiuity of thy captiues in the midst of
them;</ab>
<ab n="54">That thou mayest
beare thine owne shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou
hast done, in that thou art a comfort vnto them.</ab>
<ab n="55">When thy
sisters, Sodom and her daughters shal returne to their former
estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall returne to their former
estate, then thou and thy daughters shall returne to your former
estate.</ab>
<ab n="56">For thy sister
Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy
pride;<note> Heb. for a report or hearing. , Heb. prides or excellencies.</note></ab>
<ab n="57">Before thy
wickednesse was discouered, as at the time of thy reproch of the
daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters
of the Philistines which despise thee round about.<note> Heb. Aram. , Or spoile.</note></ab>
<ab n="58">Thou hast borne
thy lewdnesse, and thine abominations, saith the Lord.<note> Heb. borne them.</note></ab>
<ab n="59">For thus saith
the Lord God; I will euen deale with thee as thou hast done, which
hast despised the oath in breaking the couenant.</ab>
<ab n="60">¶
Neuerthelesse I will remember my couenant with thee in the dayes of
thy youth, and I will establish vnto thee an euerlasting
couenant.</ab>
<ab n="61">Then thou shalt
remember thy wayes and be ashamed, when thou shalt receiue thy
sisters, thine elder and thy younger, and I will giue them vnto
thee for daughters, but not by thy couenant.<note> Gal.4.26.</note></ab>
<ab n="62">And I will
establish my couenant with thee, and thou shalt know that I am the
Lord:</ab>

<fw>The two Eagles.</fw>
<ab n="63">That thou mayest
remember, and bee confounded, and neuer open thy mouth any more:
because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee, for all that
thou hast done, sayeth the Lord God.</ab>
