CXXIII.</head>
<head>1 The godly professe their
confidence in God, 3 and pray to be deliuered from
contempt.</head>

<ab n="1">[A song of
degrees.] Vnto thee lift I vp mine eyes: O thou that dwellest in
the heauens.</ab>
<ab n="2">Beholde, as the
eyes of seruants looke vnto the hand of their Masters, and as the
eyes of a maiden, vnto the hand of her mistresse: so our eyes waite
vpon the Lord our God, vntill that he haue mercy vpon vs.</ab>
<ab n="3">Haue mercy vpon
vs, O Lord, haue mercy vpon vs: for we are exceedingly filled with
contempt.</ab>
<ab n="4">Our soule is
exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease: and
with the contempt of the proud.</ab>
