<head>CHAP. II.</head>
<head>1 The vanitie of humane courses in
the workes of pleasure. 12 Though the wise be better then the
foole, yet both haue one euent. 18 The vanitie of humane labour, in
leauing it they know not to whom. 24 Nothing better then ioy in our
labour, but that is Gods gift.</head>

<ab n="1">I said in
mine heart, Goe to now, I wil prooue thee with mirth, therfore
enioy pleasure: and behold, this also is vanitie.</ab>

<fw>The vanitie of all worldly
things.</fw>
<ab n="2">I saide of
laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?</ab>
<ab n="3">I sought in
mine heart to giue my selfe vnto wine, (yet acquainting mine heart
with wisedome) and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was
that good for the sonnes of men, which they should doe vnder the
heauen all the dayes of their life.<note> Chap. 1. 17. , Hebr. to draw my flesh with wine. , Hebr. the number of the dayes of their life.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">I made me
great workes, I builded mee houses, I planted mee
Uineyards.</ab>
<ab n="5">I made mee
gardens &amp; orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kinde of
fruits.</ab>
<ab n="6">I made mee
pooles of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth foorth
trees:</ab>
<ab n="7">I got me
seruants and maydens, and had seruants borne in my house; also I
had great possessions of great and small cattell, aboue all that
were in Ierusalem before me.<note> Heb. sonnes of my house.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">I gathered
mee also siluer and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of
the prouinces: I gate mee men singers and women singers, and the
delights of the sonnes of men, as musical instruments, and that of
all sorts.<note> 1. King.9. 28. and 10. 4. , Hebr. musicall instrument, and instruments.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">So I was
great, and increased more then all that were before mee in
Ierusalem; also my wisedome remained with me.</ab>
<ab n="10">And
whatsoeuer mine eyes desired, I kept not from them; I withheld not
my heart from any ioy: for my heart reioyced in all my labour; and
this was my portion of all my labour.</ab>
<ab n="11">Then I
looked on all the workes that my hands had wrought, and on the
labour that I had laboured to doe: and behold, all was vanitie, and
vexation of spirit, and there was no profit vnder the
Sunne.<note> Chap.1.3.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">¶ And I
turned my selfe to behold wisedome, and madnesse and folly: for
what can the man doe, that commeth after the king? euen that which
hath bene already done.<note> Chap. 1. 17. and 7. 23. , Or, in those things which haue bene already done.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Then I saw
that wisedome excelleth folly, as farre as light excelleth
darkenesse.<note> Hebr. That there is an excellencie in Wisedome more then in folly,&amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">The wise
mans eyes are in his head, but the foole walketh in darknes: and I
my selfe perceiued also that one euent happeneth to them
all.<note> Prou. 17. 24. chap. 8. 1.</note></ab>

<fw>The vanitie of all worldly
things.</fw>
<ab n="15">Then said I
in my heart, As it happeneth to the foole, so it happeneth euen to
me, and why was I then more wise? then I said in my heart, That
this also is vanitie.<note> Hebr. happeneth to me, euen to me.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">For there is
no remembrance of the wise, more then of the foole for euer; seeing
that which now is, in the dayes to come shall be forgotten; and how
dieth the wise man? as the foole.</ab>
<ab n="17">Therefore I
hated life, because the worke that is wrought vnder the Sunne is
grieuous vnto mee: for all is vanitie, and vexation of
spirit.</ab>
<ab n="18">¶ Yea I
hated all my labour which I had taken vnder the Sunne: because I
should leaue it vnto the man that shalbe after mee.<note> Hebr. laboured.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">And who
knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a foole? yet shall he
haue rule ouer all my labour, wherein I haue laboured, and wherein
I haue shewed my selfe wise vnder the Sunne. This is also
vanitie.<note> Psal.49. 11. &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">Therefore I
went about to cause my heart to despaire of all the labour which I
tooke vnder the Sunne.</ab>
<ab n="21">For there is
a man whose labour is in wisedome and in knowledge, and in equitie:
yet to a man that hath not laboured therein, shall hee leaue it for
his portion; This also is vanitie, and a great euill.<note> Hebr. giue.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">For what
hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart
wherein hee hath laboured vnder the Sunne?<note> Chap.1.3. and 3.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">For all his
dayes are sorrowes, and his traueile, griefe; yea his heart taketh
not rest in the night. This is also vanitie.<note> Iob 14.1.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">¶ There
is nothing better for a man, then that he should eat and drinke,
and that he should make his soule enioy good in his labour. This
also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.<note> Cha. 3.12, 22. and 5. 17. and 8. 15. , Or, delight his senses.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">For who can
eate? or who else can hasten hereunto more then I?</ab>
<ab n="26">For God
giueth to a man that is good in his sight, wisedome, and knowledge,
and ioy: but to the sinner hee giueth traueile, to gather and to
heape vp that he may giue to him that is good before God: This also
is vanitie and vexation of spirit.<note> Hebr. before him. , Iob 27. 17.</note></ab>
