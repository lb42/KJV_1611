<head>CHAP.
XVIII.</head>
<head>3 Paul laboureth with his hands, and
preacheth at Corinth to the Gentiles. 9 The Lord encourageth him in
a vision. 12 Hee is accused before Gallio the deputie, but is
dismissed. 18 Afterwards passing from citie to citie, he
strengtheneth the disciples. 24 Apollos, being more perfectly
instructed by Aquila and Priscilla, 28 preacheth Christ with great
efficacie.</head>

<ab n="1">After these
things, Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth,</ab>
<ab n="2">And found a
certaine Iewe named Aquila, borne in Pontus, lately come from
Italy, with his wife Priscilla, (because that Claudius had
commanded all Iewes to depart from Rome) and came vnto
them.<note> Rom.16.3</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And because
hee was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought (for by
their occupation they were tentmakers.)</ab>
<ab n="4">And hee
reasoned in the Synagogue euery Sabbath, and perswaded the Iewes,
and the Greekes.</ab>
<ab n="5">And when Silas
and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in spirit,
and testified to the Iewes, that Iesus was Christ.</ab>
<ab n="6">And when they
opposed themselues, and blasphemed, he shooke his raiment, and said
vnto them, Your blood be vpon your owne heads, I am cleane: from
henceforth I will goe vnto the Gentiles.<note> Mat.10. 14.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">¶ And hee
departed thence, and entred into a certaine mans house, named
Iustus, one that worshipped God, whose house ioyned hard to the
Synagogue.</ab>
<ab n="8">And Crispus,
the chiefe ruler of the Synagogue, beleeued on the Lord, with all
his house: and many of the Corinthians, hearing, beleeued, and were
baptized.<note> 1.Cor.1. 14.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">Then spake the
Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speake,
and holde not thy peace:</ab>

<fw>Aquila and Priscilla instruct
Apollos.</fw>
<ab n="10">For I am with thee,
and no man shal set on thee, to hurt thee: for I haue much people
in this city.</ab>
<ab n="11">And hee continued
there a yeere and sixe monethes, teaching the word of God among
them.<note> Gr. sate there.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">¶ And when
Gallio was the Deputie of Achaia, the Iewes made insurrection with
one accord against Paul, and brought him to the iudgement
seat,</ab>
<ab n="13">Saying, This fellow
perswadeth men to worship God contrary to the Law.</ab>
<ab n="14">And when Paul was
now about to open his mouth, Gallio said vnto the Iewes, If it were
a matter of wrong, or wicked lewdnesse, O yee Iewes, reason would
that I should beare with you.</ab>
<ab n="15">But if it be a
question of words, and names, and of your law, looke ye to it: for
I wil be no iudge of such matters.</ab>
<ab n="16">And he draue them
from the iudgment seate.</ab>
<ab n="17">Then all the
Greekes tooke Sosthenes the chiefe ruler of the Synagogue, and beat
him before the Iudgement seat: and Gallio cared for none of those
things.</ab>
<ab n="18">¶ And Paul
after this taried there yet a good while, and then tooke his leaue
of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him
Priscilla and Aquila: hauing shorne his head in Cenchrea: for he
had a vow.</ab>
<ab n="19">And he came to
Ephesus, and left them there: but he himselfe entred into the
Synagogue, and reasoned with the Iewes.</ab>
<ab n="20">When they desired
him to tary longer time with them, hee consented not:</ab>
<ab n="21">But bade them
farewell, saying, I must by all meanes keepe this feast that
commeth, in Hierusalem; but I will returne againe vnto you, if God
will: and he sailed from Ephesus.<note> 1.Cor.4. 19. iam.4. 15.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">And when he had
landed at Cesarea, and gone vp, and saluted the Church, he went
downe to Antioch.</ab>
<ab n="23">And after he had
spent some time there, hee departed, and went ouer all the countrey
of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the
disciples.</ab>
<ab n="24">¶ And a
certaine Iew, named Apollos, borne at Alexandria, an eloquent man,
and mightie in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.<note> 1.Cor.1. 12.</note></ab>

<fw>Aquila and Priscilla instruct
Apollos.</fw>
<ab n="25">This man was
instructed in the way of the Lord, and being feruent in the spirit,
he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing
onely the baptisme of Iohn.</ab>
<ab n="26">And he began to
speake boldly in the Synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had
heard, they tooke him vnto them, and expounded vnto him the way of
God more perfectly.</ab>
<ab n="27">And when hee was
disposed to passe into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the
disciples to receiue him: who, when he was come, helped them much
which had beleeued throgh grace.</ab>
<ab n="28">For hee mightily
conuinced the Iewes, and that publikely, shewing by the scriptures,
that Iesus was Christ.</ab>
