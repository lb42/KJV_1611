<head>CHAP.
VII.</head>
<head>1 Elisha prophecieth incredible
plenty in Samaria. 3 Foure Lepers venturing on the host of the
Syrians, bring tydings of their flight. 22 The king finding by
spies the newes to be true, spoileth the tents of the Syrians. 17
The Lord, who would not beleeue the prophecy of plenty, hauing the
charge of the gate, is troden to death in the presse.</head>

<ab n="1">Then Elisha said,
Heare yee the word of the Lord, Thus saith the Lord, To morrowe
about this time shal a measure of fine flower be sold for a
shekell, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of
Samaria.</ab>
<ab n="2">Then a lord on
whose hand the king leaned, answered the man of God, and said,
Behold, if the Lord would make windowes in heauen, might this thing
bee? and he saide, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eies, but
shalt not eate thereof.<note> Heb. a Lord which belonged to the King, leaning vpon his hand.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">¶ And there
were foure leprous men at the entring in of the gate: and they
saide one to another, Why sit wee here vntill we die?</ab>

<fw>The Syrians flee.</fw>
<ab n="4">If we say, We will
enter into the citie, then the famine is in the citie, and wee
shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now
therefore come, and let vs fall vnto the host of the Syrians: if
they saue vs aliue, we shall liue; and if they kill vs, we shall
but die.</ab>
<ab n="5">And they rose vp
in the twilight, to goe vnto the campe of the Syrians: and when
they were come to the vttermost part of the campe of Syria, behold,
there was no man there.</ab>
<ab n="6">For the Lord had
made the host of the Syrians to heare a noise of charets, and a
noise of horses, euen the noise of a great host: and they said one
to another, Loe, the king of Israel hath hired against vs the kings
of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come vpon
vs.</ab>
<ab n="7">Wherefore they
arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their
horses, and their asses, euen the campe as it was, and fled for
their life.</ab>
<ab n="8">And when these
lepers came to the vttermost part of the campe, they went into one
tent, and did eate, and drinke, and carried thence siluer, and
gold, and raiment, and went and hid it, and came againe, and entred
into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid
it.</ab>
<ab n="9">Then they said one
to another, We doe not well: this day is a day of good tydings, and
we hold our peace: if we tarie till the morning light, some
mischiefe will come vpon vs: nowe therefore come, that we may goe,
and tell the kings houshold.<note> Heb. we shall find punishment.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">So they came, and
called vnto the porter of the citie: and they told them, saying; We
came to the campe of the Syrians, and behold, there was no man
there, neither voice of man, but horses tyed, and asses tyed, and
the tents as they were.</ab>
<ab n="11">And hee called
the porters, and they told it to the kings house within.</ab>
<ab n="12">¶ And the
king arose in the night, and said vnto his seruants, I will now
shew you what the Syrians haue done to vs: They know that we be
hungrie, therefore are they gone out of the camp, to hide
themselues in the field, saying; When they come out of the citie,
we shal catch them aliue, and get into the citie.</ab>

<fw>Plenty in Samaria.</fw>
<ab n="13">And one of his
seruants answered, and said, Let some take, I pray thee, fiue of
the horses that remaine, which are left in the citie: (behold, they
are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I
say, they are euen as all the multitude of the Israelites that are
consumed) and let vs send, and see.<note> Heb. in it.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">They tooke
therefore two charet horses, and the king sent after the hoste of
the Syrians, saying, Goe, and see.</ab>
<ab n="15">And they went
after them vnto Iordane, and loe, all the way was full of garments,
and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste: and
the messengers returned, and told the king.</ab>
<ab n="16">And the people
went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians: So a measure of
fine flowre was sold for a shekell, and two measures of barley for
a shekel, according to the word of the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="17">¶ And the
king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned, to haue the charge
of the gate: and the people trode vpon him in the gate, and he
died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came
downe to him.</ab>
<ab n="18">And it came to
passe, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two
measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flowre for a
shekel, shalbe to morrow about this time, in the gate of
Samaria:</ab>
<ab n="19">And that lord
answered the man of God, and said, Now behold, if the Lord should
make windowes in heauen, might such a thing be? And he said,
Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eate
thereof.</ab>
<ab n="20">And so it fell
out vnto him: for the people trode vpon him in the gate, and he
died.</ab>
