<head>CHAP. X.</head>
<head>1 God threatneth to send locusts. 7
Pharaoh, moued by his seruants, inclineth to let the Israelites
goe. 12 The plague of the locusts. 16 Pharaoh sueth to Moses. 21
The plague of darkenesse. 24 Pharaoh sueth vnto Moses, 27 but yet
is hardened.</head>

<ab n="1">And the Lord said
vnto Moses, Goe in vnto Pharaoh: for I haue hardned his heart, and
the heart of his seruants, that I might shew these my signes before
him:<note> Chap.4. 21.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And that thou
mayest tell in the eares of thy sonne, and of thy sonnes sonne,
what things I haue wrought in Egypt, and my signes which I haue
done amongst them, that ye may know how that I am the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="3">And Moses and
Aaron came in vnto Pharaoh, and saide vnto him, Thus saith the Lord
God of the Hebrewes, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thy selfe
before mee? Let my people goe, that they may serue me.</ab>
<ab n="4">Els, if thou
refuse to let my people goe, behold, to morrow will I bring the
locusts into thy coast.<note> Wisd. 16. 9.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">And they shall
couer the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the
earth, and they shall eate the residue of that which is escaped,
which remaineth vnto you from the haile, and shall eate euery tree,
which groweth for you out of the field.<note> Hebr. eye.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">And they shall
fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy seruants, and the houses
of all the Egyptians, which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers
fathers haue seene, since the day that they were vpon the earth,
vnto this day. And he turned himselfe, and went out from
Pharaoh.</ab>
<ab n="7">And Pharaohs
seruants said vnto him, How long shall this man be a snare vnto vs?
Let the men goe, that they may serue the Lord their God: Knowest
thou not yet, that Egypt is destroyed?</ab>

<fw>Locusts couer Egypt.</fw>
<ab n="8">And Moses and
Aaron were brought againe vnto Pharaoh: and he said vnto them, Goe,
serue the Lord your God: but who are they that shall
goe?<note> Heb. who &amp; who, &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And Moses said, We
wil goe with our yong, and with our old, with our sonnes and with
our daughters, with our flockes and with our heards will we goe:
for we must hold a feast vnto the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="10">And he said vnto
them; Let the Lord bee so with you, as I will let you goe, and your
litle ones. Looke to it, for euill is before you.</ab>
<ab n="11">Not so: goe now
yee that are men, and serue the Lord, for that you did desire: and
they were driuen out from Pharaohs presence.</ab>
<ab n="12">¶ And the
Lord said vnto Moses, Stretch out thine hand ouer the land of Egypt
for the locusts, that they may come vp vpon the land of Egypt, and
eate euery herbe of the land, euen all that the haile hath
left.</ab>
<ab n="13">And Moses
stretched forth his rod ouer the land of Egypt, and the Lord
brought an East wind vpon the land all that day, and all that
night: and when it was morning, the East wind brought the
locusts.</ab>
<ab n="14">And the locusts
went vp ouer all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of
Egypt: very grieuous were they: before them there were no such
locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.</ab>
<ab n="15">For they couered
the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkned, and they
did eate euery herbe of the land, and all the fruit of the trees,
which the haile had left, and there remained not any greene thing
in the trees, or in the herbes of the field, through all the land
of Egypt.</ab>
<ab n="16">¶ Then
Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste: and he said, I haue
sinned against the Lord your God, and against you.<note> Heb. hastened to call.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">Now therefore
forgiue, I pray thee, my sinne onely this once, and intreat the
Lord your God, that hee may take away from mee this death
onely.</ab>
<ab n="18">And he went out
from Pharaoh, and intreated the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="19">And the Lord
turned a mighty strong West wind, which tooke away the locusts, and
cast them into the red sea: there remained not one locust in all
the coasts of Egypt.<note> Heb. fastened.</note></ab>

<fw>Thicke darkenes.</fw>
<ab n="20">But the Lord
hardened Pharaohs heart, so that hee would not let the children of
Israel goe.</ab>
<ab n="21">¶ And the
Lord said vnto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heauen, that
there may be darkenesse ouer the land of Egypt, euen darkenes which
may be felt.<note> Heb. that one may feele darkenesse.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">And Moses
stretched foorth his hand toward heauen: and there was a thicke
darkenesse in all the land of Egypt three dayes.</ab>
<ab n="23">They saw not one
another, neither rose any from his place for three dayes: but all
the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.<note> Wisd. 18.1</note></ab>
<ab n="24">¶ And
Pharaoh called vnto Moses, and said, Goe ye, serue the Lord: onely
let your flockes and your herds be stayed: let your litle ones also
goe with you.</ab>
<ab n="25">And Moses saide,
Thou must giue vs also sacrifices, and burnt offerings, that we may
sacrifice vnto the Lord our God.<note> Heb. into our hands.</note></ab>
<ab n="26">Our cattell also
shall goe with vs: there shall not an hoofe bee left behind: for
thereof must we take to serue the Lord our God: and we knowe not
with what wee must serue the Lord, vntill we come thither.</ab>
<ab n="27">¶ But the
Lord hardened Pharaohs heart, and he would not let them
goe.</ab>
<ab n="28">And Pharaoh said
vnto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thy selfe: see my face no
more: for in that day thou seest my face, thou shalt die.</ab>
<ab n="29">And Moses said,
Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face againe no more.</ab>
