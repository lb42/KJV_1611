<head>CHAP. IV.</head>
<head>1 The parable of the sower, 14 and
the meaning thereof. 21 We must communicate the light of our
knowledge to others. 26 The parable of the seede growing secretly,
30 and of the Mustard seede. 35 Christ stilleth the tempest on the
Sea.</head>

<ab n="1">And he beganne
againe to teach by the Sea side: and there was gathered vnto him a
great multitude, so that he entred into a ship, and sate in the
Sea: and the whole multitude was by the Sea on the
land.<note> Matth.13.1.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And he taught
them many things by parables, and said vnto them in his
doctrine,</ab>
<ab n="3">Hearken,
Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</ab>
<ab n="4">And it came to
passe as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the foules of the
aire came, &amp; deuoured it vp.</ab>
<ab n="5">And some fell
on stonie ground, where it had not much earth: and immediately it
sprang vp, because it had no depth of earth.</ab>
<ab n="6">But when the
Sunne was vp, it was scorched, and because it had no roote, it
withered away.</ab>
<ab n="7">And some fell
among thornes, and the thornes grew vp, and choked it, and it
yeelded no fruite.</ab>
<ab n="8">And other fell
on good ground, and did yeeld fruite that sprang vp, and increased,
and brought foorth some thirtie, &amp; some sixtie, &amp; some an
hundred.</ab>
<ab n="9">And he said
vnto them, He that hath eares to heare, let him heare.</ab>
<ab n="10">And when hee
was alone, they that were about him, with the twelue, asked of him
the parable.</ab>
<ab n="11">And he said
vnto them, Unto you it is giuen to know the mystery of the kingdome
of God: but vnto them that are without, all these things are done
in parables:</ab>
<ab n="12">That seeing
they may see, and not perceiue, and hearing they may heare, and not
vnderstand, lest at any time they should be conuerted, and their
sinnes should be forgiuen them.<note> Matth.13.14.</note></ab>

<fw>The parable of the seed.</fw>
<ab n="13">And he said
vnto them, Know ye not this parable? And how then will you know all
parables?</ab>
<ab n="14">¶ The
Sower soweth the word.</ab>
<ab n="15">And these are
they by the way side, where the word is sowen, but when they haue
heard, Satan commeth immediately, and taketh away the word that was
sowen in their hearts.</ab>
<ab n="16">And these are
they likewise which are sowen on stonie ground, who when they haue
heard the word, immediately receiue it with gladnesse:</ab>
<ab n="17">And haue no
roote in themselues, and so endure but for a time: afterward when
affliction or persecution ariseth for the words sake, immediately
they are offended.</ab>
<ab n="18">And these are
they which are sowen among thorns: such as heare the word,</ab>
<ab n="19">And the cares
of this world, and the deceitfulnesse of riches, and the lusts of
other things entring in, choke the word, and it becommeth
vnfruitfull.<note> 1.Tim.6.17.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">And these are
they which are sowen on good ground, such as heare the word, and
receiue it, &amp; bring foorth fruit, some thirty fold, some
sixtie, and some an hundred.</ab>
<ab n="21">¶ And he
said vnto them, Is a candle brought to be put vnder a bushell, or
vnder a bed? &amp; not to be set on a candlesticke?<note> Matth.5.15. , The word, in the originall, signifieth a lesse measure as Mat. 5.15.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">For there is
nothing hid, which shall not be manifested: neither was any thing
kept secret, but that it should come abroad.<note> Matth.10.26.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">If any man
haue eares to heare, let him heare.</ab>
<ab n="24">And he said
vnto them, Take heed what you heare: With what measure ye mete, it
shalbe measured to you: And vnto you that heare, shal more be
giuen.<note> Matth.7.2.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">For he that
hath, to him shall be giuen: and he that hath not, from him shall
be taken, euen that which he hath.<note> Matth.13.12.</note></ab>
<ab n="26">¶ And he
said, So is the kingdome of God, as if a man should cast seede into
the ground,</ab>
<ab n="27">And should
sleepe, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring, and
grow vp, he knoweth not how.</ab>
<ab n="28">For the earth
bringeth foorth fruite of herselfe, first the blade, then the eare,
after that the full corne in the eare.</ab>
<ab n="29">But when the
fruite is brought foorth, immediately he putteth in the sickle,
because the haruest is come.<note> Or, ripe.</note></ab>

<fw>The sea calmed.</fw>
<ab n="30">¶ And he
said, Wherunto shal we liken the kingdome of God? Or with what
comparison shall we compare it?<note> Matth.13.31.</note></ab>
<ab n="31">It is like a
graine of mustard seed: which when it is sowen in the earth, is
lesse then all the seedes that be in the earth.</ab>
<ab n="32">But when it is
sowen, it groweth vp, and becommeth greater then all herbes, &amp;
shooteth out great branches, so that the fowles of the aire may
lodge vnder the shadow of it.</ab>
<ab n="33">And with many
such parables spake hee the word vnto them, as they were able to
heare it.<note> Matth.13.34.</note></ab>
<ab n="34">But without a
parable spake he not vnto them, and when they were alone, hee
expounded all things to his disciples.</ab>
<ab n="35">And the same
day, when the Euen was come, he saith vnto them, Let vs passe ouer
vnto the other side.<note> Matth.8.23.</note></ab>
<ab n="36">And when they
had sent away the multitude, they tooke him, euen as he was in the
ship, and there were also with him other litle ships.</ab>
<ab n="37">And there
arose a great storme of wind, and the waues beat into the ship, so
that it was now full.</ab>
<ab n="38">And he was in
the hinder part of the ship asleepe on a pillow: and they awake
him, and say vnto him, Master, carest thou not, that we
perish?</ab>
<ab n="39">And hee arose,
and rebuked the winde, and said vnto the sea, Peace, be still: and
the winde ceased, and there was a great calme.</ab>
<ab n="40">And he said
vnto them, Why are ye so fearefull? How is it that you haue no
faith?</ab>
<ab n="41">And they
feared exceedingly, and saide one to another, What maner of man is
this, that euen the winde and the sea obey him?</ab>
