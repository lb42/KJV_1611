<head>CHAP. V.</head>
<head>1 Christ deliuering the possessed of
the Legion of deuils, 13 They enter into the swine, 25 Hee healeth
the woman of the bloody issue, 35 and raiseth from death Iairus his
daughter.</head>

<ab n="1">And they came
ouer vnto the other side of the sea, into the countrey of the
Gadarenes.<note> Matth. 8.28.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And when hee
was come out of the ship, immediatly there met him out of the
tombes, a man with an vncleane spirit,</ab>
<ab n="3">Who had his
dwelling among the tombs, and no man could binde him, no not with
chaines:</ab>

<fw>Of the swine.</fw>
<ab n="4">Because that
hee had bene often bound with fetters and chaines, and the chaines
had bene plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces:
neither could any man tame him.</ab>
<ab n="5">And alwayes
night and day, hee was in the mountaines, and in the tombes,
crying, and cutting himselfe with stones.</ab>
<ab n="6">But when hee
saw Iesus afarre off, he came and worshipped him,</ab>
<ab n="7">And cried with
a lowd voice, and said, What haue I to doe with thee, Iesus, thou
Sonne of the most high God? I adiure thee by God, that thou torment
me not.</ab>
<ab n="8">(For he said
vnto him, Come out of the man, thou vncleane spirit.)</ab>
<ab n="9">And he asked
him, What is thy name? And hee answered, saying, My name is Legion:
for we are many.</ab>
<ab n="10">And hee
besought him much, that he would not send them away out of the
countrey.</ab>
<ab n="11">Now there was
there nigh vnto the mountaines a great herd of swine,
feeding.</ab>
<ab n="12">And all the
deuils besought him, saying, Send vs into the swine, that we may
enter into them.</ab>
<ab n="13">And forthwith
Iesus gaue them leaue. And the vncleane spirits went out, and
entred into the swine, and the herd ranne violently downe a steepe
place into the sea (they were about two thousand) and were choked
in the sea.</ab>
<ab n="14">And they that
fed the swine fled, and tolde it in the citie, and in the countrey.
And they went out to see what it was that was done.</ab>
<ab n="15">And they come
to Iesus, and see him that was possessed with the deuill, and had
the Legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right minde: and they
were afraid.</ab>
<ab n="16">And they that
saw it, tolde them how it befell to him that was possessed with the
deuill, and also concerning the swine.</ab>
<ab n="17">And they began
to pray him to depart out of their coasts.</ab>
<ab n="18">And when hee
was come into the ship, he that had bene possessed with the deuill
prayed him that hee might bee with him.</ab>

<fw>Iairus daughter restored to
life.</fw>
<ab n="19">Howbeit Iesus
suffered him not, but saith vnto him, Goe home to thy friends, and
tel them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had
compassion on thee.</ab>
<ab n="20">And hee
departed, and began to publish in Decapolis, how great things Iesus
had done for him: and all men did marueile.</ab>
<ab n="21">And when Iesus
was passed ouer againe by ship vnto the other side, much people
gathered vnto him, and he was nigh vnto the Sea.</ab>
<ab n="22">And behold,
there commeth one of the Rulers of the Synagogue, Iairus by name,
and when he saw him, he fell at his feete,<note> Mat. 9.18.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">And besought
him greatly, saying, My litle daughter lieth at the point of death,
I pray thee come and lay thy hands on her, that shee may be healed,
and she shall liue.</ab>
<ab n="24">And Iesus went
with him, and much people followed him, and thronged him.</ab>
<ab n="25">And a certaine
woman which had an issue of blood twelue yeeres,</ab>
<ab n="26">And had
suffered many things of many Physicians, and had spent all that she
had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,</ab>
<ab n="27">When shee had
heard of Iesus, came in the prease behinde, and touched his
garment.</ab>
<ab n="28">For she said,
If I may touch but his clothes, I shalbe whole.</ab>
<ab n="29">And
straightway the fountaine of her blood was dried vp: and she felt
in her body that she was healed of that plague.</ab>
<ab n="30">And Iesus
immediatly knowing in himselfe that vertue had gone out of him,
turned him about in the preasse, and said, Who touched my
clothes?</ab>
<ab n="31">And his
disciples said vnto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee,
and sayest thou, Who touched me?</ab>
<ab n="32">And he looked
round about to see her that had done this thing.</ab>
<ab n="33">But the woman
fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell
downe before him, and tolde him all the trueth.</ab>
<ab n="34">And he said
vnto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole, goe in peace,
and be whole of thy plague.</ab>
<ab n="35">While hee yet
spake, there came from the Ruler of the Synagogues house, certaine
which said, Thy daughter is dead, why troublest thou the Master any
further?</ab>

<fw>Iairus daughter restored to
life.</fw>
<ab n="36">Assoone as
Iesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith vnto the Ruler of
the Synagogue, Be not afraid, onely beleeue.</ab>
<ab n="37">And he
suffered no man to follow him, saue Peter, &amp; Iames, and Iohn
the brother of Iames.</ab>
<ab n="38">And hee
commeth to the house of the Ruler of the Synagogue, and seeth the
tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.</ab>
<ab n="39">And when he
was come in, hee saith vnto them, Why make yee this adoe, and
weepe? the damosell is not dead, but sleepeth.</ab>
<ab n="40">And they
laughed him to scorne: but when he had put them all out, hee taketh
the father and the mother of the damosell, and them that were with
him, and entreth in where the damosell was lying.</ab>
<ab n="41">And he tooke
the damosell by the hand, and said vnto her, Talitha cumi, which
is, being interpreted, Damosell (I say vnto thee) Arise.</ab>
<ab n="42">And
straightway the damosell arose, and walked, for shee was of the age
of twelue yeeres: and they were astonished with a great
astonishment.</ab>
<ab n="43">And hee
charged them straitly, that no man should know it: and commanded
that some thing should be giuen her to eate.</ab>
