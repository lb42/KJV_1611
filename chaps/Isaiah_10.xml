<head>CHAP. X.</head>
<head>1 The woe of tyrants. 5 Assyria, the
rodde of hypocrites, for his pride shall be broken. 20 A remnant of
Israel shall be saued. 24 Israel is comforted with promise of
deliuerance from Assyria.</head>

<ab n="1">Woe vnto them that
decree vnrighteous decrees, and that write grieuousnesse which they
haue prescribed:<note> Or, to the writers that write grieuousnesse.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">To turne aside the
needy from iudgement, and to take away the right from the poore of
my people, that widdowes may be their pray, and that they may robbe
the fatherles.</ab>
<ab n="3">And what wil ye
doe in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall
come from farre? To whom wil ye flee for helpe? And where will yee
leaue your glory?</ab>
<ab n="4">Without mee they
shall bowe downe vnder the prisoners, and they shall fall vnder the
slaine: for all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is
stretched out still.<note> Cha.5.25 and 9.12.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">¶ O Assyrian,
the rod of mine anger, and the staffe in their hand is mine
indignation.<note> Or, woe to the Assyrian. , Heb. Asshur. , Or, though.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">I will send him
against an hypocriticall nation, and against the people of my wrath
will I giue him a charge to take the spoile, and to take the praye,
and to tread them downe like the mire of the streets.<note> Heb. to lay them a treading.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">Howbeit he meaneth
not so, neither doth his heart thinke so, but it is in his heart to
destroy, and cut off nations not a few.</ab>

<fw>Asshurs pride.</fw>
<ab n="8">For he saith, Are
not my princes altogether kings?<note> 2.Kings 18.24, 33. and 19.10, &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">Is not Calno, as
Carchemish? Is not Hamath, as Arpad? Is not Samaria, as
Damascus?</ab>
<ab n="10">As my hand hath
found the kingdomes of the idoles, and whose grauen images did
excell them of Ierusalem and of Samaria:</ab>
<ab n="11">Shall I not, as I
haue done vnto Samaria and her idoles, so doe to Ierusalem and her
idoles?</ab>
<ab n="12">Wherefore it
shall come to passe, that when the Lord hath performed his whole
worke vpon mount Zion, and on Ierusalem, I will punish the fruit of
the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high
lookes.<note> 2.Kings 19.31. , Heb. visite vpon. , Heb. of the greatnesse of the heart.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">For hee saith, By
the strength of my hand I haue done it, and by my wisedome, for I
am prudent: and I haue remooued the bounds of the people, and haue
robbed their treasures, and I haue put downe the inhabitants like a
valiant man.<note> Or, like many people.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And my hand hath
found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth
egges that are left, haue I gathered all the earth, and there was
none that moued the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.</ab>
<ab n="15">Shall the axe
boast it selfe against him that heweth therewith? Or shal the sawe
magnifie it selfe against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should
shake it selfe against them that lift it vp, or as if the staffe
should lift vp it selfe, as if it were no wood.<note> Or, as if a rod should shake them that lift it vp. , Or, that which is not wood.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">Therefore shall
the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leannesse, and
vnder his glory hee shall kindle a burning, like the burning of a
fire.</ab>
<ab n="17">And the light of
Israel shall bee for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it
shall burne and deuoure his thornes and his briers in one
day:</ab>
<ab n="18">And shall consume
the glory of his forrest, and of his fruitfull field both soule and
body: and they shall bee as when a standerd bearer
fainteth.<note> Heb. from the soule and euen to the flesh.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">And the rest of
the trees of his forrest shall be few, that a child may write
them.<note> Heb. number.</note></ab>

<fw>A remnant saued.</fw>
<ab n="20">¶ And it
shal come to passe in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and
such as are escaped of the house of Iacob, shall no more againe
stay vpon him that smote them: but shall stay vpon the Lord, the
Holy One of Israel in trueth.</ab>
<ab n="21">The remnant shall
returne, euen the remnant of Iacob, vnto the mightie God.</ab>
<ab n="22">For though thy
people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them
shall returne: the consumption decreed shall ouerflow with
righteousnesse.<note> Cha 28.22 rom.9.27. , Heb. in or amongst. , Or, in.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">For the Lord God
of hostes shall make a consumption, euen determined in the middest
of all the land.<note> Chap.28. 22.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">¶ Therfore
thus saith the Lord God of hostes, O my people that dwellest in
Zion, be not afraide of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a
rod, and shall lift vp his staffe against thee, after the maner of
Egypt.<note> Or, but hee shall lift vp his staffe for thee. , Exod. 14.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">For yet a very
litle while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in
their destruction.</ab>
<ab n="26">And the Lord of
hostes shall stirre vp a scourge for him, according to the
slaughter of Midian at the rocke Oreb: and as his rod was vpon the
Sea, so shall he lift it vp after the manner of Egypt.<note> Iudg.7.25 cha.9.4.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">And it shall come
to passe in that day, that his burden shalbe taken away from off
thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy necke, and the yoke shalbe
destroyed because of the anointing.<note> Hebr. shall remoue.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">He is come to
Aiath, hee is passed to Migron: at Michmash he hath laid vp his
cariages.</ab>
<ab n="29">They are gone
ouer the passage: they haue taken vp their lodging at Geba, Ramah
is afraid, Gebeah of Saul is fled.</ab>
<ab n="30">Lift vp thy
voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to bee heard vnto Laish, O
poore Anathoth.<note> Heb. crie shrill with thy voice.</note></ab>
<ab n="31">Madmenah is
remooued, the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselues to
flee.</ab>
<ab n="32">As yet shall hee
remaine at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand against the mount
of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Ierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="33">Behold, the Lord,
the Lord of hostes shall lop the bough with terrour: and the high
ones of stature shal be hewen downe, and the haughtie shalbe
humbled.</ab>
<ab n="34">And he shall cut
downe the thickets of the forrests with yron, and Lebanon shall
fall by a mightie one.<note> Or, mightily.</note></ab>
