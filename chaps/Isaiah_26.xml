<head>CHAP.
XXVI.</head>
<head>1 A song inciting to confidence in
God, 5 for his iudgements, 12 and for his fauour to his people. 20
An exhortation to wait on God.</head>

<ab n="1">In that day shall
this song bee sung in the land of Iudah; Wee haue a strong citie,
saluation will God appoint for walles and bulwarkes.</ab>
<ab n="2">Open ye the gates,
that the righteous nation which keepeth the trueth may enter
in.<note> Hebr. trueths.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">Thou wilt keepe
him in perfect peace, whose minde is stayed on thee; because he
trusteth in thee.<note> Hebr. peace, peace. , Or, thought, or imagination.</note></ab>

<fw>Prayer in trouble.</fw>
<ab n="4">Trust ye in the
Lord for euer: for in the Lord Iehouah is euerlasting
strength.<note> Heb. the rocke of ages.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">¶ For hee
bringeth downe them that dwell on high, the loftie citie he layeth
it low; he layeth it low, euen to the ground, he bringeth it euen
to the dust.</ab>
<ab n="6">The foote shall
treade it downe, euen the feete of the poore, and the steps of the
needie.</ab>
<ab n="7">The way of the
iust is vprightnesse: thou most vpright, doest weigh the path of
the iust.</ab>
<ab n="8">Yea in the way of
thy Iudgements, O Lord, haue we waited for thee; the desire of our
soule is to thy Name, and to the remembrance of thee.</ab>
<ab n="9">With my soule haue
I desired thee in the night, yea with my spirit within me will I
seeke thee early: for when thy iudgements are in the earth, the
inhabitants of the world will learne righteousnesse.</ab>
<ab n="10">Let fauour be
shewed to the wicked, yet will hee not learne righteousnesse: in
the land of vprightnesse will he deale vniustly, and will not
behold the maiestie of the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="11">Lord, when thy
hand is lifted vp, they will not see: but they shall see, and be
ashamed for their enuie at the people, yea the fire of thine
enemies shall deuoure them.<note> Or, towards thy people.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">¶ Lord, thou
wilt ordaine peace for vs: for thou also hast wrought all our
workes in vs.<note> Or, for vs.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">O Lord our God,
other lordes besides thee haue had dominion ouer vs: but by thee
only will we make mention of thy Name.</ab>
<ab n="14">They are dead,
they shall not liue; they are deceased, they shall not rise:
therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their
memory to perish.</ab>
<ab n="15">Thou hast
increased the nation, O Lord, thou hast increased the nation, thou
art glorified; thou hadst remooued it farre vnto all the ends of
the earth.</ab>
<ab n="16">Lord, in trouble
haue they visited thee: they powred out a prayer when thy
chastening was vpon them.<note> Heb. secret speech.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">Like as a woman
with childe that draweth neere the time of her deliuerie, is in
paine and cryeth out in her pangs; so haue wee beene in thy sight,
O Lord.</ab>

<fw>The resurrection.</fw>
<ab n="18">Wee haue beene
with childe, wee haue beene in paine, we haue as it were brought
foorth winde, wee haue not wrought any deliuerance in the earth,
neither haue the inhabitants of the world fallen.</ab>
<ab n="19">Thy dead men
shall liue, together with my dead body shall they arise: awake and
sing yee that dwell in dust: for thy dewe is as the dewe of herbes,
and the earth shall cast out the dead.</ab>
<ab n="20">¶ Come, my
people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doores about
thee; hide thy selfe as it were for a little moment, vntill the
indignation be ouerpast.</ab>
<ab n="21">For behold, the
Lord commeth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the
earth for their iniquitie: the earth also shall disclose her blood,
and shall no more couer her slaine.<note> Mic.1.3. , Heb. bloods</note></ab>
