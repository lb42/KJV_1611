<head>CHAP.
XIX.</head>
<head>1 The Cities of refuge. 4 The
priuiledge thereof for the manslayer. 14 The land-marke is not to
be remooued. 15 Two witnesses at the least. 16 The punishment of a
false witnesse.</head>

<ab n="1">When the Lord
thy God hath cut off the nations, whose lande the Lord thy God
giueth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their
cities, and in their houses:<note> Chap. 12. 29. , Heb. inheritest, or possessest.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">Thou shalt
separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the
Lord thy God giueth thee to possesse it.<note> Exod. 21. 13. num. 35 10. iosh. 20 2.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">Thou shalt
prepare thee a way, and diuide the coasts of thy land (which the
Lord thy God giueth thee to inherit) into three parts, that euery
slayer may flee thither.</ab>
<ab n="4">¶ And
this is the case of the slayer which shall flee thither, that hee
may liue: who so killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated
not in time past,<note> Heb. from yesterday the third day.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">As when a man
goeth into the wood with his neighbor, to hew wood, and his hand
fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut downe the tree, and the head
slippeth from the helue, and lighteth vpon his neighbour that he
die, he shall flee vnto one of those cities, and liue:<note> Heb. yron. , Heb. wood. , Heb. findeth.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">Lest the
auenger of the blood pursue the slaier, while his heart is hot, and
ouertake him, because the way is long, and slay him, whereas he was
not worthy of death, in as much as hee hated him not in time
past.<note> Heb. smite him in life. , Heb. from yesterday, third day.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">Wherefore I
command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for
thee.</ab>
<ab n="8">And if the
Lord thy God enlarge thy coast (as he hath sworne vnto thy fathers)
and giue thee all the lande which hee promised to giue vnto thy
fathers:</ab>
<ab n="9">(If thou
shalt keepe all these commandements to doe them, which I command
thee this day, to loue the Lord thy God, and to walke euer in his
wayes) then shalt thou adde three cities moe for thee, beside these
three:<note> Chap. 12. 20. , Iosh.20.7</note></ab>

<fw>A false witnesse.</fw>
<ab n="10">That
innocent blood be not shed in thy land which the Lord thy God
giueth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be vpon thee.</ab>
<ab n="11">¶ But
if any man hate his neighbour and lie in wait for him, and rise vp
against him, and smite him mortally that hee die, and fleeth into
one of these Cities:<note> Hebr. in life.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">Then the
Elders of his citie shall send and fetch him thence, and deliuer
him into the hand of the auenger of blood, that he may die.</ab>
<ab n="13">Thine eye
shall not pittie him, but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent
blood from Israel, that it may goe wel with thee.</ab>
<ab n="14">¶ Thou
shalt not remooue thy neighbours land-marke, which they of old time
haue set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherite, in the
land that the Lord thy God giueth thee to possesse it.</ab>
<ab n="15">¶ One
witnesse shall not rise vp against a man for any iniquitie, or for
any sinne, in any sinne that he sinneth: at the mouth of two
witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be
stablished.<note> Chap.17. 6. Hebr.10. 28. numb. 35.30. mat. 18.16. ioh. 8.17. 2. cor. 13.1. Hebr.10.28.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">¶ If a
false witnes rise vp against any man to testifie against him that
which is wrong:<note> Or, falling away.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">Then both
the men betweene whom the controuersie is, shall stand before the
Lord, before the Priests, and the Iudges, which shall be in those
dayes.</ab>
<ab n="18">And the
Iudges shall make diligent inquisition: and behold, if the witnesse
be a false witnesse, and hath testified falsly against his
brother:</ab>
<ab n="19">Then shall
ye doe vnto him, as he had thought to haue done vnto his brother:
so shalt thou put the euil away from among you.<note> Prou. 19. 5,9. dan. 13. 62.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">And those
which remaine shall heare, and feare, and shall hencefoorth commit
no more any such euill among you.</ab>
<ab n="21">And thine
eye shall not pitie, but life shall goe for life, eye for eye,
tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.<note> Exod. 21. 23. leuit. 24.20. mat. 5.38.</note></ab>
