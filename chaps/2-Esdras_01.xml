the Lord came vnto me, saying,<note> Isa.58.1.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">Goe thy way, and
shew my people their sinfull deeds, and their children their
wickednes which they haue done against me, that they may tell their
childrens children,</ab>
<ab n="6">Because the
sinnes of their fathers are increased in them: for they haue
forgotten me, &amp; haue offered vnto strange gods.</ab>
<ab n="7">Am not I euen hee
that brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the house of
bondage? but they haue prouoked me vnto wrath, and despised my
counsels.</ab>
<ab n="8">Pull thou off
then the haire of thy head, and cast all euill vpon them, for they
haue not beene obedient vnto my law, but it is a rebellious
people.</ab>
<ab n="9">How long shall I
forbeare them vnto wh≈ç I haue done so much good?</ab>
<ab n="10">Many kings haue
I destroyed for their sakes, Pharao with his seruants, and all his
power haue I smitten downe.<note> Exod.14. 28.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">All the nations
haue I destroyed before them, &amp; in the East I haue scattered
the people of two prouinces, euen of Tyrus and Sidon, and haue
slaine all their enemies.<note> Num. 21. 24. iosh.8. 12.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">Speake thou
therefore vnto them saying, Thus saith the Lord,</ab>
<ab n="13">I led you
through the Sea, and in the beginning gaue you a large and safe
passage, I gaue you Moyses for a leader, and Aaron for a
priest,<note> Exod.14. 29. , Or, street. , Exo. 3.10. and 4.14.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">I gaue you light
in a pillar of fire, and great wonders haue I done among you, yet
haue you forgotten me, saith the Lord.<note> Exod.13. 21.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">Thus saith the
Almightie Lord, The quailes were as a token for you, I gaue you
tents for your safegard, neuerthelesse you murmured
there,<note> Exod.16. 13. psal.104 40.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">And triumphed
not in my name for the destruction of your enemies, but euer to
this day doe ye yet murmure.</ab>
<ab n="17">Where are the
benefits that I haue done for you? when you were hungry and
thirstie in the wildernesse, did you not crie vnto me?<note> Num. 14.3.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Saying, Why hast
thou brought vs into this wildernesse to kill vs? It had bin better
for vs to haue serued the Egyptians, then to die in this
wildernesse.</ab>
<ab n="19">Then had I pity
vpon your mournings, and gaue you Manna to eat, so ye did eate
Angels bread.<note> Wisd.16. 20.</note></ab>

thirstie, did I not cleaue the rocke, and waters flowed out to your
fill? for the heate I couered you with the leaues of the
trees.<note> Numb. 20 11. wisd. 11 4. , Or, abundantly.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">I diuided
amongst you a fruitfull land, I cast out the Canaanites, the
Pherezites, and the Philistines before you: what shall I yet doe
more for you: saith the Lord?<note> Isa. 5.4. &amp; exod. 15.23</note></ab>
<ab n="22">Thus saith the
Almighty Lord, when you were in the wildernes in the riuer of the
Amorites, being athirst, and blaspheming my Name,<note> Or, at the bitter waters, or waters of Marah.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">I gaue you not
fire for your blasphemies, but cast a tree in the water, and made
the riuer sweet.</ab>
<ab n="24">What shall I doe
vnto thee, O Iacob? thou Iuda wouldest not obey me: I will turne me
to other nations, and vnto those will I giue my Name, that they may
keepe my Statutes.<note> Exo.32.8.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">Seeing yee haue
forsaken mee, I will forsake you also: when yee desire me to be
gracious vnto you, I shall haue no mercy vpon you.</ab>
<ab n="26">Whensoeuer you
shall call vpon me, I will not heare you: for yee haue defiled your
hands with blood, and your feete are swift to commit
manslaughter.<note> Isa.1.15.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">Yee haue not as
it were forsaken me, but your owne selues, saith the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="28">Thus saith the
Almighty Lord, Haue I not prayed you as a father his sonnes, as a
mother her daughters, and a nurse her young babes,</ab>
<ab n="29">That yee would
be my people, and I shoud be your God, that ye would be my
children, and I should be your father?<note> Or, as I am your God</note></ab>
<ab n="30">I gathered you
together, as a henne gathereth her chickens vnder her wings: but
now, what shall I doe vnto you? I will cast you out from my
face.<note> Mat.23. 37.</note></ab>
<ab n="31">When you offer
vnto me, I will turne my face from you: for your solemne feast
dayes, your newe Moone, and your circumcisions haue I
forsaken.<note> Isa.1.13.</note></ab>
<ab n="32">I sent vnto you
my seruants the Prophets, whom yee haue taken and slaine, and torne
their bodies in pieces, whose blood I will require of your hands,
saith the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="33">Thus saith the
Almighty Lord, Your house is desolate, I will cast you out, as the
wind doth stubble.</ab>
<ab n="34">And your
children shall not bee fruitful: for they haue despised my
Commandement, and done the thing that is euill before me.</ab>
<ab n="35">Your houses wil
I giue to a people that shall come, which not hauing heard of mee,
yet shall beleeue mee, to whom I haue shewed no signes, yet they
shall doe that I haue commaunded them.</ab>
<ab n="36">They haue seene
no Prophets, yet they shall call their sinnes to remembrance, and
acknowledge them.</ab>
<ab n="37">I take to
witnesse the grace of the people to come, whose little ones reioyce
in gladnesse: and though they haue not seene me with bodily eyes,
yet in spirit they beleeue the thing that I say.</ab>
<ab n="38">And now brother,
behold what glory: and see the people that commeth from the
East.</ab>
<ab n="39">Unto whom I will
giue for leaders, Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, Oseas, Amos, and
Micheas, Ioel, Abdias, and Ionas,</ab>
<ab n="40">Nahum, and
Abacuc, Sophonias, Aggeus, Zacharie, and Malachie, which is called
also an Angel of the Lord.<note> Mala. 3.1.</note></ab>
