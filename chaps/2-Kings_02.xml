<ab n="1">And it came to

whirlewinde, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</ab>
<ab n="2">And Elijah said
vnto Elisha, Tarie here, I pray thee: for the Lord hath sent me to
Bethel: and Elisha said vnto him, As the Lord liueth, and as thy
soule liueth, I wil not leaue thee. So they went downe to
Bethel.</ab>
<ab n="3">And the sonnes of
the Prophets that were at Bethel, came foorth to Elisha, and said
vnto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from
thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it, hold you your
peace.</ab>
<ab n="4">And Elijah said
vnto him, Elisha, tarie here, I pray thee: for the Lord hath sent
me to Iericho: And hee said, As the Lord liueth, and as thy soule
liueth, I will not leaue thee. So they came to Iericho.</ab>

<fw>Elijah taken vp.</fw>
<ab n="5">And the sonnes of
the Prophets that were at Iericho came to Elisha, and said vnto
him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy
head to day? And hee answered, Yea, I knowe it, holde you your
peace.</ab>
<ab n="6">And Elijah said
vnto him, Tarie, I pray thee, here: for the Lord hath sent me to
Iordan. And he said, As the Lord liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I
will not leaue thee. And they two went on.</ab>
<ab n="7">And fiftie men of
the sonnes of the Prophets went, and stood to view afarre off: and
they two stood by Iordan.<note> Hebr. in sight, or ouer against.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">And Elijah tooke
his mantle, and wrapt it together, and smote the waters, and they
were diuided hither and thither, so that they two went ouer on drie
ground.</ab>
<ab n="9">¶ And it came
to passe when they were gone ouer, that Elijah said vnto Elisha,
Aske what I shall doe for thee, before I be taken away from thee.
And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be
vpon me.</ab>
<ab n="10">And hee said,
Thou hast asked a hard thing: neuerthelesse, if thou see me, when I
am taken from thee, it shall be so vnto thee: but if not, it shall
not be so.<note> Hebr. thou hast done hard in asking.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And it came to
passe as they still went on and talked, that beholde, there
appeared a charet of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both
asunder, and Elijah went vp by a whirlewind into
heauen.<note> Ecclus.48 9. 1. mac.2. 58.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">¶ And Elisha
saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the charet of Israel,
and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he tooke hold
of his owne cloathes, and rent them in two pieces.<note> Chap.13. 14.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">He tooke vp also
the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood
by the banke of Iordan.<note> Hebr. lip.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And he tooke the
mantle of Eliiah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and
said, Where is the Lord God of Elijah? And when hee also had
smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went
ouer.</ab>
<ab n="15">And when the
sonnes of the Prophets which were to view at Iericho, saw him, they
said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha: And they came to
meet him, and bowed themselues to the ground before
him.<note> Verse 7.</note></ab>

<fw>Waters healed.</fw>
<ab n="16">¶ And they
said vnto him, Behold now, there bee with thy seruants fiftie
strong men, let them goe, we pray thee, and seeke thy master: lest
peraduenture the Spirit of the Lord hath taken him vp, and cast him
vpon some mountaine, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not
send.<note> Hebr. sonnes of strength. , Hebr. one of the mountaines.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">And when they
vrged him, till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore
fiftie men, and they sought three dayes, but found him not.</ab>
<ab n="18">And when they
came againe to him (for he taried at Iericho) hee said vnto them,
Did I not say vnto you, Goe not?</ab>
<ab n="19">¶ And the
men of the city said vnto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the
situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water
is nought, and the ground barren.<note> Hebr. causing to miscary.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">And hee said,
Bring mee a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to
him.</ab>
<ab n="21">And he went forth
vnto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and
said, Thus saith the Lord, I haue healed these waters; there shall
not be from thence any more death, or barren land.</ab>
<ab n="22">So the waters
were healed vnto this day, according to the saying of Elisha, which
he spake.</ab>
<ab n="23">¶ And he
went vp from thence vnto Bethel: and as hee was going vp by the
way, there came foorth little children out of the citie, and mocked
him, and said vnto him, Goe vp thou bald head, Goe vp thou bald
head.</ab>
<ab n="24">And hee turned
backe, and looked on them, and cursed them in the Name of the Lord:
and there came foorth two shee Beares out of the wood, and tare
fortie and two children of them.</ab>
<ab n="25">And hee went from
thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to
Samaria.</ab>
