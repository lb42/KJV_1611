<fw>Saul trembleth.</fw>
<ab n="1">And it came to
passe in those dayes, that the Philistines gathered their armies
together for warfare, to fight with Israel: And Achish said vnto
Dauid, Knowe thou assuredly, that thou shalt goe out with me to
battell, thou, and thy men.</ab>
<ab n="2">And Dauid said
to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy seruant can doe. And
Achish said to Dauid, Therfore will I make thee keeper of mine head
for euer.</ab>
<ab n="3">¶ Now
Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in
Ramah, euen in his owne citie: and Saul had put away those that had
familiar spirits, and the wyzards, out of the land.<note> Chap. 25. 1.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">And the
Philistines gathered themselues together, and came and pitched in
Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in
Gilboa.</ab>
<ab n="5">And when Saul
saw the hoste of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart
greatly trembled.</ab>
<ab n="6">And when Saul
enquired of the Lord, the Lord answered him not, neither by
dreames, nor by Urim, nor by Prophets.</ab>
<ab n="7">¶ Then said
Saul vnto his seruants, Seeke me a woman that hath a familiar
spirit, that I may goe to her, and enquire of her. And his seruant
said to him, Beholde, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit
at Endor.</ab>
<ab n="8">And Saul
disguised himselfe, and put on other raiment, and hee went, and two
men with him, and they came to the woman by night, and he said, I
pray thee diuine vnto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him
vp whom I shall name vnto thee.</ab>
<ab n="9">And the woman
saide vnto him, Beholde, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how hee
hath cut off those that haue familiar spirits, and the wyzards out
of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to
cause me to die?</ab>
<ab n="10">And Saul sware
to her by the Lord, saying, As the Lord liueth, there shall no
punishment happen to thee for this thing.</ab>
<ab n="11">Then said the
woman, Whome shall I bring vp vnto thee? and he said, Bring me vp
Samuel.</ab>

<fw>Saul is with the witch at
Endor.</fw>
<ab n="12">And when the
woman saw Samuel, she cried with a lowd voyce; and the woman spake
to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceiued me? for thou art
Saul.</ab>
<ab n="13">And the king
sayd vnto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman
said vnto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.</ab>
<ab n="14">And he said
vnto her, What forme is he of? And she said, An old man commeth vp,
and he is couered with a mantle. And Saul perceiued that it was
Samuel, and hee stouped with his face to the ground, and bowed
himselfe.<note> Hebr. what is his forme?</note></ab>
<ab n="15">¶ And
Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me vp?
And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistins make
war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no
more, neither by Prophets, nor by dreames: therefore I haue called
thee, that thou mayst make knowen vnto me, what I shall
doe.<note> Hebr. by the hand of Prophets.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">Then said
Samuel, Wherefore then doest thou aske of mee, seeing the Lord is
departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?</ab>
<ab n="17">And the Lord
hath done to him, as hee spake by mee: for the Lord hath rent the
kingdome out of thine hand, and giuen it to thy neighbour, euen to
Dauid:<note> Or, for himselfe. , Chap. 15. 28. , Hebr. mine hand.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Because thou
obeiedst not the voice of the Lord, nor executedst his fierce wrath
vpon Amalek, therefore hath the Lord done this thing vnto thee this
day.</ab>
<ab n="19">Moreouer, the
Lord will also deliuer Israel with thee, into the hand of the
Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sonnes bee with mee:
the Lord also shall deliuer the hoste of Israel into the hand of
the Philistines.</ab>
<ab n="20">Then Saul fell
straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of
the words of Samuel, &amp; there was no strength in him: for he had
eaten no bread all the day, nor al the night.<note> Heb. made haste and fel with the fulnesse of his stature.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">¶ And the
woman came vnto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and sayd
vnto him, Behold, thine handmayd hath obeyed thy voice, and I haue
put my life in my hand, and haue hearkened vnto thy words which
thou spakest vnto me:</ab>
<ab n="22">Now therefore,
I pray thee, hearken thou also vnto the voyce of thine handmaid,
&amp; let me set a morsel of bread before thee; &amp; eat, that
thou mayest haue strength, when thou goest on thy way.</ab>

<fw>Saul is with the witch at
Endor.</fw>
<ab n="23">But hee
refused, and said, I will not eate. But his seruants together with
the woman compelled him, and he hearkened vnto their voyce: so he
arose from the earth, &amp; sate vpon the bed.</ab>
<ab n="24">And the woman
had a fat calfe in the house, and she hasted, and killed it, and
tooke flower and kneaded it, and did bake vnleauened bread
thereof.</ab>
<ab n="25">And she brought
it before Saul, and before his seruants, and they did eate: then
they arose vp, and went away that night.</ab>
