<head>CHAP.
VII.</head>
<head>1 The Pharises find fault at the
disciples for eating with vnwashen hands. 8 They breake the
commandement of God, by the traditions of men. 4 Meate defileth not
the man. 24 Hee healeth the Syrophenician womans daughter of an
vncleane spirit, 31 and one that was deafe, and stammered in his
speach.</head>

<ab n="1">Then came
together vnto him the Pharises, and certain of the Scribes, which
came from Hierusalem.<note> Matth.15 1.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And when they
saw some of his disciples eate bread with defiled (that is to say,
with vnwashen) hands, they found fault.<note> Or, common.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">For the
Pharises and all the Iewes, except they wash their hands oft, eate
not, holding the tradition of the elders.<note> Or, diligently, in the Originall, with the fist: Theophilact, vp to the elbowe.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">And when they
come from the market, except they wash, they eate not. And many
other things there be, which they haue receiued to hold, as the
washing of cups and pots, brasen vessels, and of
tables.<note> Or, beds. , Sextarius, is about a pinte and an halfe.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">Then the
Pharises and Scribes asked him, Why walke not thy disciples
according to the tradition of the Elders, but eate bread with
vnwashen hands?</ab>
<ab n="6">He answered and
said vnto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you Hypocrites, as
it is written, This people honoureth mee with their lips, but their
heart is farre from me.<note> Esai.29.13. mat.15.8.</note></ab>

<fw>What defileth.</fw>
<ab n="7">Howbeit in
vaine doe they worship me, teaching for doctrines, the
commandements of men.</ab>
<ab n="8">For laying
aside the Commandement of God, yee hold the tradition of men, as
the washing of pots, and cups: and many other such like things ye
doe.</ab>
<ab n="9">And he said
vnto them, Full well ye reiect the Commandement of God, that ye may
keepe your owne tradition.<note> Or, frustrate.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">For Moses
said, Honour thy father &amp; thy mother: and who so curseth father
or mother, let him die the death.</ab>
<ab n="11">But ye say, If
a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to
say, a gift, by whatsoeuer thou mightest be profited by me: he
shalbe free.<note> Matth. 15.5.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">And ye suffer
him no more to doe ought for his father, or his mother:</ab>
<ab n="13">Making the
word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye haue
deliuered: And many such like things doe ye.</ab>
<ab n="14">¶ And
when he had called all the people vnto him, hee said vnto them,
Hearken vnto me euery one of you, and vnderstand.<note> Matt. 15.10.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">There is
nothing from without a man that entring into him, can defile him:
but the things which come out of of him, those are they that defile
the man.</ab>
<ab n="16">If any man
haue eares to heare, let him heare.</ab>
<ab n="17">And when hee
was entred into the house from the people, his disciples asked him
concerning the parable.</ab>
<ab n="18">And he saith
vnto them, Are ye so without vnderstanding also? Doe yee not
perceiue that whatsoeuer thing from without entreth into the man,
it cannot defile him,</ab>
<ab n="19">Because it
entreth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into
the draught, purging all meats?</ab>
<ab n="20">And he said,
That which commeth out of the man, that defileth the man.</ab>
<ab n="21">For from
within, out of the heart of men, proceed euill thoughts,
adulteries, fornications, murders,<note> Gen.6.5. and 8.21.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">Thefts,
couetousnesse, wickednesse, deceit, lasciuiousnesse, an euill eye,
blasphemie, pride, foolishnesse:<note> Matth. 15.19.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">All these
euill things come from within, and defile the man.</ab>
<ab n="24">¶ And
from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon,
and entred into an house, and would haue no man know it, but hee
could not be hid.<note> Matt. 15.21.</note></ab>

<fw>The deafe healed.</fw>
<ab n="25">For a certaine
woman, whose yong daughter had an vncleane spirit, heard of him,
and came and fell at his feete.</ab>
<ab n="26">(The woman was
a Greek: a Syrophenician by nation:) and she besought him that he
would cast forth the deuill out of her daughter.<note> Or, Gentile.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">But Iesus said
vnto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to
take the childrens bread, and to cast it vnto the dogges.</ab>
<ab n="28">And she
answered and said vnto him, Yes Lord, yet the dogges vnder the
table eat of the childrens crummes.</ab>
<ab n="29">And hee said
vnto her, For this saying, goe thy way, the deuill is gone out of
thy daughter.</ab>
<ab n="30">And when shee
was come to her house, she found the deuill gone out, and her
daughter laied vpon the bed.</ab>
<ab n="31">¶ And
againe departing from the coastes of Tyre and Sidon, he came vnto
the sea of Galilee, thorow the midst of the coasts of
Decapolis.</ab>
<ab n="32">And they bring
vnto him one that was deafe, and had an impediment in his speech:
and they beseech him to put his hand vpon him.</ab>
<ab n="33">And he tooke
him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his eares,
and he spit, and touched his tongue,</ab>
<ab n="34">And looking vp
to heauen, hee sighed, and saith vnto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be
opened.</ab>
<ab n="35">And
straightway his eares were opened, and the string of his tongue was
loosed, and he spake plaine.</ab>
<ab n="36">And hee
charged them that they should tell no man: but the more hee charged
them, so much the more a great deale they published it,</ab>
<ab n="37">And were
beyond measure astonished, saying, Hee hath done all things well:
hee maketh both the deafe to heare, and the dumbe to
speake.</ab>
