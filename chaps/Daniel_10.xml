<head>CHAP. X.</head>
<head>1 Daniel hauing humbled himselfe,
seeth a vision. 10 Being troubled with feare, hee is comforted by
the Angel.</head>

<ab n="1">In the third yere
of Cyrus King of Persia, a thing was reuealed vnto Daniel (whose
name was called Belteshazzar) and the thing was true, but the time
appointed was long, and he vnderstood the thing, and had
vnderstanding of the vision.<note> Heb. great.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">In those dayes, I
Daniel was mourning three full weekes.<note> Heb. weeks of dayes.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">I ate no pleasant
bread, neither came flesh, nor wine in my mouth, neither did I
anoynt my selfe at all, till three whole weekes were
fulfilled.<note> Heb. bread of desires.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">And in the foure
and twentieth day of the first moneth, as I was by the side of the
great riuer, which is Hiddekel:<note> Gen.2.14.</note></ab>

<fw>He is dumbe.</fw>
<ab n="5">Then I lift vp
mine eyes and looked, and behold, a certaine man clothed in linen,
whose loynes were girded with fine gold of Uphaz.<note> Heb. one man. , Reu.1. 13,14,15.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">His body also was
like the Berill, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and
his eyes as lampes of fire, and his armes, and his feete like in
colour to polished brasse, and the voice of his words like the
voice of a multitude.</ab>
<ab n="7">And I Daniel alone
saw the vision: for the men that were with mee saw not the vision:
but a great quaking fell vpon them, so that they fled to hide
themselues.</ab>
<ab n="8">Therefore I was
left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no
strength in me: for my comelinesse was turned in me into
corruption, and I retained no strength.<note> Or, vigor. , Dan.7.28.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">Yet heard I the
voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his wordes, then
was I in a deepe sleepe on my face, and my face toward the
ground.</ab>
<ab n="10">Â¶ And
behold, an hand touched me, which set me vpon my knees, and vpon
the palmes of my hands.<note> Heb. mooued.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And hee said vnto
me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloued, vnderstand the wordes that I
speake vnto thee, and stand vpright: for vnto thee am I now sent;
and when he had spoken this word vnto me, I stood
trembling.<note> Heb. a man of desires. , Heb. stand vpon thy standing.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">Then sayd hee
vnto me; Feare not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou
diddest set thine heart to vnderstand, and to chasten thy selfe
before thy God, thy wordes were heard, and I am come for thy
words.</ab>
<ab n="13">But the prince of
the kingdome of Persia withstood mee one and twentie dayes: but
loe, Michael one of the chiefe Princes came to helpe mee, and I
remained there with the Kings of Persia.<note> Or, the first.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">Now I am come to
make thee vnderstand what shall befall thy people, in the latter
dayes: for yet the vision is for many dayes.</ab>
<ab n="15">And when hee had
spoken such words vnto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I
became dumbe.</ab>
<ab n="16">And behold, one
like the similitude of the sonnes of men touched my lippes: then I
opened my mouth, and spake, and sayd vnto him that stoode before
me; O my Lord, by the vision my sorrowes are turned vpon me, and I
haue retained no strength.</ab>

<fw>Kings of the North and South.</fw>
<ab n="17">For how can the
seruant of this my Lord, talke with this my Lord? for as for me,
straightway there remained no strength in mee, neither is there
breath left in me.<note> Or, this seruant of my Lord.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Then there came
againe and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he
strengthned me,</ab>
<ab n="19">And said; O man
greatly beloued, feare not: peace be vnto thee, be strong, yea be
strong; and when he had spoken vnto me, I was strengthened, and
said; Let my Lord speake; for thou hast strengthened me.</ab>
<ab n="20">Then said hee,
Knowest thou wherefore I come vnto thee? and now will I returne to
fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, loe, the
prince of Grecia shall come.</ab>
<ab n="21">But I will shew
thee that which is noted in the Scripture of trueth: and there is
none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your
prince.<note> Heb. strengtheneth himselfe.</note></ab>
