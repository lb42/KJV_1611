<head>CHAP. V.</head>
<head>1 The Couenant in Horeb. 6 The ten
Commandements. 22 At the peoples request Moses receiueth the Law
from God.</head>

<ab n="1">And Moses
called all Israel, and sayd vnto them, Heare, O Israel, the
Statutes and Iudgements which I speake in your eares this day, that
ye may learne them, and keepe and doe them.<note> Heb. keepe to doe them.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">The Lord our
God made a couenant with vs in Horeb.<note> Exod.19. 5.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">The Lord made
not this couenant with our fathers, but with vs: euen vs, who are
all of vs here aliue this day.</ab>
<ab n="4">The Lord
talked with you, face to face, in the mount, out of the midst of
the fire,</ab>
<ab n="5">(I stood
betweene the Lord and you, at that time, to shew you the word of
the Lord: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not vp
into the mount,) saying,</ab>
<ab n="6">¶ I am
the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the lande of Egypt,
from the house of bondage.<note> Exod.20. 2, &amp;c. leuit. 26.1. psal. 81.10. , Heb. seruants.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">Thou shalt
haue none other gods before me.</ab>
<ab n="8">Thou shalt not
make thee any grauen image, or any likenesse of any thing that is
in heauen aboue, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the
waters beneath the earth.</ab>
<ab n="9">Thou shalt not
bow downe thy selfe vnto them, nor serue them: for I the Lord thy
God am a ielous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers vpon the
children, vnto the third and fourth generation of them that hate
me,<note> Exod.34. 7.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">And shewing
mercy vnto thousands, of them that loue me, and keepe my
commandements.<note> Ierem.32. 18.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">Thou shalt
not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine: for the Lord will
not holde him guiltlesse that taketh his name in vaine.</ab>

<fw>The Law is repeated. The people is
afraid.</fw>
<ab n="12">Keepe the
Sabbath day to sanctifie it, as the Lord thy God hath commanded
thee.</ab>
<ab n="13">Sixe dayes
thou shalt labour, and doe all thy worke.</ab>
<ab n="14">But the
seuenth day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt
not doe any worke, thou, nor thy sonne, nor thy daughter, nor thy
man seruant, nor thy maid seruant, nor thine oxe, nor thine asse,
nor any of thy cattel, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates,
that thy man seruant and thy maid seruant may rest as well as
thou.<note> Gen.2.2. Heb.4.4.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">And remember
that thou wast a seruant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord
thy God brought thee out thence, through a mightie hand, and by a
stretched out arme: Therefore the Lord thy God commaunded thee to
keepe the Sabbath day.</ab>
<ab n="16">¶ Honour
thy father and thy mother, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee,
that thy daies may be prolonged, and that it may goe well with
thee, in the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee.</ab>
<ab n="17">Thou shalt
not kill.<note> Mat.5.21</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Neither shalt
thou commit adulterie.<note> Luke 18. 20.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">Neither shalt
thou steale.<note> Rom.13.9</note></ab>
<ab n="20">Neither shalt
thou beare false witnesse against thy neighbour.</ab>
<ab n="21">Neither shalt
thou desire thy neighbours wife, neither shalt thou couet thy
neighbours house, his field, or his man seruant, or his maide
seruant, his oxe, or his asse, or any thing that is thy
neighbours.<note> Rom.7.7.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">¶ These
wordes the Lord spake vnto all your assembly in the mount out of
the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thicke darkenesse,
with a great voice, and he added no more, and he wrote them in two
Tables of stone, and deliuered them vnto me.</ab>
<ab n="23">And it came
to passe when yee heard the voice out of the midst of the darkenes
(for the mountaine did burne with fire) that ye came neere vnto
mee, euen all the heads of your tribes, and your elders.</ab>
<ab n="24">And ye said,
Behold, the Lord our God hath shewed vs his glory, and his
greatnesse, and we haue heard his voice out of the midst of the
fire: wee haue seene this day that God doth talke with man, and he
liueth.<note> Exod.19. 19. , Chap.4. 33.</note></ab>

<fw>The people is afraid.</fw>
<ab n="25">Now therefore
why should wee die? for this great fire will consume vs. If we
heare the voyce of the Lord our God any more, then we shall
die.<note> Heb. adde to heare.</note></ab>
<ab n="26">For who is
there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the liuing God,
speaking out of the midst of the fire (as we haue) and
liued?</ab>
<ab n="27">Goe thou
neere, and heare all that the Lord our God shall say; and speake
thou vnto vs all that the Lord our God shall speake vnto thee, and
we will heare it, and doe it.<note> Exod.20. 19.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">And the Lord
heard the voice of your words, when ye spake vnto me, and the Lord
said vnto me, I haue heard the voice of the wordes of this people,
which they haue spoken vnto thee: they haue well said, all that
they haue spoken.</ab>
<ab n="29">O that there
were such an heart in them, that they would feare me, and keepe my
commandements alwayes, that it might bee well with them, and with
their children for euer.</ab>
<ab n="30">Goe, say to
them, Get you into your tents againe.</ab>
<ab n="31">But as for
thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speake vnto thee all the
Commandements, and the Statutes, and the Iudgements, which thou
shalt teach them, that they may doe them in the land which I giue
them to possesse it.</ab>
<ab n="32">Ye shall
obserue to doe therefore, as the Lord your God hath commanded you:
you shall not turne aside to the right hand, or to the
left.</ab>
<ab n="33">You shall
walke in all the wayes which the Lord your God hath commanded you,
that ye may liue, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may
prolong your dayes in the land which ye shall possesse.</ab>
