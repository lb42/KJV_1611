<ab n="1">[To the chiefe
musicion, a psalme of Dauid, the seruant of the Lord, who spake
vnto the Lord the words of this song, in the day that the Lord
deliuered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand
of Saul: And he said,] I will loue thee, O Lord, my
strength.</ab>
<ab n="2">The Lord is my
rocke, and my fortresse, and my deliuerer: my God, my strength in
whome I will trust, my buckler, and the horne of my saluation, and
my high tower.<note> Heb. my rocke.</note></ab>

death compassed me, and the floods of vngodly men made me

hell compassed me about: the snares of death preuented
me.<note> Or, coards.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">In my distresse I
called vpon the Lord, and cryed vnto my God: hee heard my voyce out
of his temple, and my crie came before him, euen into his
eares.</ab>
<ab n="7">Then the earth
shooke and trembled; the foundations also of the hilles mooued and
were shaken, because hee was wroth.</ab>
<ab n="8">There went vp a
smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth deuoured,
coales were kindled by it.<note> Heb. by his</note></ab>
<ab n="9">He bowed the
heauens also, and came downe: and darkenesse was vnder his
feet.</ab>
<ab n="10">And he rode vpon
a Cherub, and did flie: yea he did flie vpon the wings of the
wind.</ab>
<ab n="11">He made darkenes
his secret place: his pauilion round about him, were darke waters,
and thicke cloudes of the skies.</ab>
<ab n="12">At the brightnes
that was before him his thicke clouds passed, haile stones and
coales of fire.</ab>
<ab n="13">The Lord also
thundered in the heauens, and the highest gaue his voyce;
hailestones and coales of fire.</ab>
<ab n="14">Yea, he sent out
his arrowes, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and
discomfited them.</ab>
<ab n="15">Then the chanels
of waters were seene, and the foundations of the world were
discouered: at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the breath of
thy nostrils.</ab>

me according to my righteousnesse, according to the cleannesse of
my hands hath hee recompensed me.</ab>

the wayes of the Lord, and haue not wickedly departed from my
God.</ab>
<ab n="22">For all his
iudgements were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from
me.</ab>

feete like hindes feete, and setteth me vpon my high
places.</ab>
<ab n="34">He teacheth my
hands to warre, so that a bow of steele is broken by mine
armes.</ab>
<ab n="35">Thou hast also
