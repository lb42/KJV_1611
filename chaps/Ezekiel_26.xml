<head>CHAP.
XXVI.</head>
<head>1 Tyrus, for insulting against
Ierusalem, is threatned. 7 The power of Nebuchadrezzar against her.
15 The mourning and astonishment of the sea, at her
fall.</head>

<ab n="1">And it came to
passe in the eleuenth yeere, in the first day of the moneth, that
the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,</ab>
<ab n="2">Sonne of man,
because that Tyrus hath said against Ierusalem, Aha, she is broken
that was the gates of the people, she is turned vnto me, I shalbe
replenished now she is laid waste:</ab>
<ab n="3">Therefore thus
saith the Lord God, Behold, I am against thee, O Tyrus, and will
cause many nations to come vp against thee, as the sea causeth his
waues to come vp.</ab>
<ab n="4">And they shall
destroy the walles of Tyrus, and breake downe her towres: I will
also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a
rocke.</ab>
<ab n="5">It shall be a
place for the spreading of nets in the middest of the sea: for I
haue spoken it, saith the Lord God, and it shall become a spoile to
the nations.</ab>
<ab n="6">And her daughters
which are in the field shall be slaine by the sword, and they shall
know that I am the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="7">¶ For thus
saith the Lord God; Behold, I will bring vpon Tyrus, Nebuchadrezzar
king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the North, with horses, and
with charets, and with horsemen, and companies, and much
people.</ab>
<ab n="8">Hee shall slay
with the sword thy daughters in the field, and he shal make a fort
against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift vp the
buckler against thee.<note> Or, powre out the engine of shot.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">Hee shall set
engines of warre against thy walles, and with his axes he shall
breake downe thy towres.</ab>

<fw>Tyrus threatned.</fw>
<ab n="10">By reason of the
abundance of his horses, their dust shall couer thee: thy walles
shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheeles, and
of the charets, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter
into a citie wherein is made a breach.<note> Hebr. according to the entrings of a city broken vp.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">With the hoofes
of his horses shall he tread downe all thy streets: he shall slay
thy people by the sword, and thy strong garisons shall goe downe to
the ground.</ab>
<ab n="12">And they shall
make a spoile of thy riches, and make a pray of thy merchandise,
and they shall breake downe thy walles, and destroy thy pleasant
houses, and they shall lay thy stones, and thy timber, and thy dust
in the midst of the water.<note> Heb. houses of thy desire.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">And I wil cause
the noise of thy songs to cease, and the sound of thy harpes shalbe
no more heard.<note> Isa.24.8. iere.7.34. and 16.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And I will make
thee like the top of a rocke: they shall bee a place to spread nets
vpon: thou shalt bee built no more: for I the Lord haue spoken it,
saith the Lord God.</ab>
<ab n="15">¶ Thus
saith the Lord God to Tyrus; Shall not the Iles shake at the sound
of thy fall, when the wounded crie, when the slaughter is made in
the midst of thee?</ab>
<ab n="16">Then all the
Princes of the sea shall come downe from their thrones, and lay
away their robes, and put off their broidred garments: they shall
cloth themselues with trembling, they shall sit vpon the ground,
and shall tremble at euery moment, and be astonished at
thee.<note> Hebr. tremblings.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">And they shall
take vp a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou
destroyed that wast inhabited of Sea-faring men, the renowned
citie, which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which
cause their terrour to be on all that haunt it?<note> Reuel. 18. 9. , Hebr. of the seas.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Now shall the
Iles tremble in the day of thy fall, yea the Iles that are in the
sea, shall bee troubled at thy departure.</ab>
<ab n="19">For thus saith
the Lord God; When I shal make thee a desolate citie, like the
cities that are not inhabited, when I shall bring vp the deepe vpon
thee, and great waters shall couer thee;</ab>

<fw>Her riches.</fw>
<ab n="20">When I shall
bring thee downe, with them that descend into the pit, with the
people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the
earth, in places desolate of olde, with them that goe downe to the
pit, that thou bee not inhabited, and I shall set glorie in the
land of the liuing:</ab>
<ab n="21">I will make thee
a terrour, and thou shalt bee no more: though thou be sought for,
yet shalt thou neuer bee found againe, saith the Lord
God.<note> Hebr. terrours.</note></ab>
