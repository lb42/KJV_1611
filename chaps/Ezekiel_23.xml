<head>CHAP.
XXIII.</head>
<head>1 The whoredomes of Aholah &amp;
Aholibah. 22 Aholibah is to be plagued by her louers. 36 The
Prophet reproueth the adulteries of them both, 45 and sheweth their
iudgements.</head>

<ab n="1">The word of the
Lord came againe vnto me, saying,</ab>
<ab n="2">Sonne of man,
there were two women, the daughters of one mother.</ab>
<ab n="3">And they
committed whordomes in Egypt, they committed whordomes in their
youth: there were their brests pressed, and there they bruised the
teats of their virginitie.</ab>
<ab n="4">And the names of
them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were
mine, &amp; they bare sonnes and daughters: thus were their names:
Samaria is Aholah, and Ierusalem Aholibah.</ab>
<ab n="5">And Aholah played
the harlot, when she was mine, &amp; she doted on her louers, on
the Assyrians her neighbors,</ab>
<ab n="6">Which were
clothed with blew, captaines and rulers, all of them desireable
yong men, horsemen riding vpon horses.</ab>
<ab n="7">Thus she
committed her whordomes with them, with all them that were the
chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted, with all
their idoles she defiled her selfe.<note> Heb. bestowed her whoredomes vpon them. , Heb. the choise of the children of Asshur.</note></ab>

<fw>Against Aholah, and Aholibah.</fw>
<ab n="8">Neither left she
her whoredomes brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with
her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginitie, and powred
their whoredome vpon her.</ab>
<ab n="9">Wherefore I haue
deliuered her into the hand of her louers, into the hand of the
Assyrians, vpon whom she doted.<note> 2.Kings 17.18.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">These discouered
her nakednes, they tooke her sonnes and her daughters, and slew her
with the sword: and she became famous among women, for they had
executed iudgement vpon her.<note> Heb. a name.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And when her
sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate
loue then she, and in her whoredoms more then her sister in her
whoredomes.<note> Heb. she corrupted her inordinate loue more then &amp;c. , Heb. more then the whoredomes of her sister.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">She doted vpon
the Assyrians her neighbours, captaines and rulers clothed most
gorgeously, horsemen riding vpon horses, all of them desireable
young men.<note> 2.Kings. 16.7.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Then I saw that
she was defiled, that they tooke both one way;</ab>
<ab n="14">And that she
increased her whoredomes: for when shee saw men pourtrayed vpon the
wall, the images of the Caldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,</ab>
<ab n="15">Girded with
girdles vpon their loynes, exceeding in dyed attire vpon their
heads, all of them princes to looke to, after the maner of the
Babylonians of Caldea, the land of their natiuitie:</ab>
<ab n="16">And assoone as
shee saw them with her eyes, she doted vpon them, and sent
messengers vnto them into Caldea.<note> Hebr. at the sight of her eyes.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">And the
Babylonians came to her into the bed of loue, and they defiled her
with their whoredome, and shee was polluted with them, and her mind
was alienated from them.<note> Hebr. children of Babel. , Hebr. loosed or disioynted.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">So shee
discouered her whoredomes, and discouered her nakednesse; then my
mind was alienated from her, like as my minde was alienated from
her sister.</ab>
<ab n="19">Yet shee
multiplied her whoredomes, in calling to remembrance the dayes of
her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of
Egypt.</ab>
<ab n="20">For she doted
vpon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and
whose issue is like the issue of horses.</ab>

<fw>Against Aholah, and Aholibah.</fw>
<ab n="21">Thus thou
calledst to remembrance the lewdnesse of thy youth, in bruising thy
teates by the Egyptians, for the paps of thy youth.</ab>
<ab n="22">¶
Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will
raise vp thy louers against thee, from whom thy minde is alienated,
and I will bring them against thee on euery side;</ab>
<ab n="23">The Babylonians,
and all the Caldeans, Pekod, and Shoah, and Koa, all the the
Assyrians with them, all of them desireable young men, captaines
and rulers, great lords and renowmed, all of them riding vpon
horses.</ab>
<ab n="24">And they shall
come against thee with charets, wagons and wheeles, and with an
assemblie of people which shall set against thee buckler, and
shield, and helmet round about: and I will set iudgement before
them, and they shal iudge thee according to their
iudgements.</ab>
<ab n="25">And I will set
my ielousie against thee, and they shall deale furiously with thee:
they shall take away thy nose and thine eares, and thy remnant
shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sonnes and thy
daughters, and thy residue shal be deuoured by the fire.</ab>
<ab n="26">They shall also
strippe thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy faire
iewels.<note> Hebr. instruments of thy decking.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">Thus will I make
thy lewdnesse to cease from thee, and thy whoredome brought from
the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift vp thine eyes vnto
them, nor remember Egypt any more.</ab>
<ab n="28">For thus saith
the Lord God; Beholde, I will deliuer thee into the hand of them
whom thou hatest; into the hand of them from whom thy mind is
alienated.</ab>
<ab n="29">And they shall
deale with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and
shall leaue thee naked and bare, and the nakednesse of thy
whoredomes shall bee discouered, both thy lewdnesse and thy
whoredomes.</ab>
<ab n="30">I wil doe these
things vnto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the
heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idoles.</ab>
<ab n="31">Thou hast walked
in the way of thy sister, therefore will I giue her cup into thine
hand.</ab>

<fw>Aholah, and Aholibah.</fw>
<ab n="32">Thus sayth the
Lord God, Thou shalt drinke of thy sisters cuppe deepe and large:
thou shalt be laughed to scorne and had in derision; it containeth
much.</ab>
<ab n="33">Thou shalt be
filled with drunkennesse and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment
and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.</ab>
<ab n="34">Thou shalt euen
drinke it and sucke it out, and thou shalt breake the sheards
thereof, and plucke off thine owne breasts: for I haue spoken it,
saith the Lord God.</ab>
<ab n="35">Therefore thus
sayth the Lord God, Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me
behinde thy backe, therfore beare thou also thy lewdnesse, and thy
whoredomes.</ab>
<ab n="36">¶ The Lord
said moreouer vnto mee, Sonne of man, wilt thou iudge Aholah and
Aholibah? yea declare vnto them their abominations;<note> Cha.20.4. and 22.2. , Or, plead for.</note></ab>
<ab n="37">That they haue
committed adulterie, and blood is in their handes, and with their
idoles haue they committed adulterie, and haue also caused their
sonnes, whom they bare vnto me, to passe for them through the fire
to deuoure them.</ab>
<ab n="38">Moreouer this
they haue done vnto me: they haue defiled my Sanctuarie in the same
day, and haue profaned my Sabbaths.</ab>
<ab n="39">For when they
had slaine their children to their idoles, then they came the same
day into my Sanctuarie to profane it, and loe, thus haue they done
in the middest of mine house.<note> 2.Kings 21.4.</note></ab>
<ab n="40">And furthermore
that yee haue sent for men to come from farre, vnto whom a
messenger was sent, and loe they came; for whom thou didst wash thy
selfe, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thy selfe with
ornaments,<note> Heb. comming.</note></ab>
<ab n="41">And satest vpon
a stately bedde, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou
hast set mine incense and mine oile.<note> Heb. honourable. , Prou.7.17</note></ab>
<ab n="42">And a voice of a
multitude being at ease was with her, and with the men of the
common sort were brought Sabeans from the wildernesse, which put
bracelets vpon their hands, and beautifull crownes vpon their
heads.<note> Heb. of the multitude of men. , Or, drunkards.</note></ab>
<ab n="43">Then said I vnto
her that was olde in adulteries; Will they now commit whoredomes
with her, and shee with them?<note> Her whordomes.</note></ab>

<fw>Aholah, and Aholibah.</fw>
<ab n="44">Yet they went in
vnto her, as they goe in vnto a woman that playeth the harlot: so
went they in vnto Aholah &amp; vnto Aholibah the lewd
women.</ab>
<ab n="45">¶ And the
righteous men, they shall iudge them after the manner of
adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood;
because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their
handes.<note> Chap.16. 38.</note></ab>
<ab n="46">For thus sayth
the Lord God, I will bring vp a company vpon them, and will giue
them to be remoued and spoiled.<note> Heb. for a remoouing and spoyle.</note></ab>
<ab n="47">And the companie
shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords:
they shall slay their sonnes and their daughters, and burne vp
their houses with fire.<note> Or, single them out.</note></ab>
<ab n="48">Thus will I
cause lewdnesse to cease out of the land, that all women may be
taught not to doe after your lewdnesse.</ab>
<ab n="49">And they shall
recompense your lewdnesse vpon you, and ye shall beare the sinnes
of your idoles, and yee shall know that I am the Lord God.</ab>
