<head>CHAP. VI.</head>
<head>1 Daniel is made chiefe of the
Præsidents. 4 They conspiring against him, obtaine an
idolatrous decree. 10 Daniel accused of the breach thereof, is cast
into the Lions denne. 18 Daniel is saued. 24 His aduersaries
deuoured, 25 and God magnified by a decree.</head>

<ab n="1">It pleased
Darius to set ouer the kingdome an hundred and twenty Princes,
which should be ouer the whole kingdome.</ab>
<ab n="2">And ouer
these, three Presidents, (of whom Daniel was first) that the
Princes might giue accompts vnto them, and the King should haue no
damage.</ab>
<ab n="3">Then this
Daniel was preferred aboue the Presidents, and Princes, because an
excellent spirit was in him, and the king thought to set him ouer
the whole realme.</ab>
<ab n="4">¶ Then
the Presidents and Princes sought to finde occasion against Daniel
concerning the kingdome, but they could finde none occasion, nor
fault: forasmuch as he was faithfull, neither was there any errour
or fault found in him.</ab>
<ab n="5">Then said
these men, We shall not finde any occasion against this Daniel,
except wee finde it against him concerning the Law of his
God.</ab>
<ab n="6">Then these
Presidents and Princes assembled together to the king, and said
thus vnto him, King Darius, liue foreuer.<note> Or, came tumultuously.</note></ab>

<fw>Darius his decree.</fw>
<ab n="7">All the
Presidents of the kingdome, the gouernours, and the Princes, the
counsellers and the captaines haue consulted together to establish
a royall statute, and to make a firme decree, that whosoeuer shall
aske a petition of any God or man for thirty dayes, saue of thee, O
King, hee shall be cast into the denne of Lions.<note> Or, interdict.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Now, O king,
establish the decree, and signe the writing, that it be not
changed, according to the law of the Medes &amp; Persians, which
altereth not.<note> Esth.2.1, and 8.8. , Cald. passeth not.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">Wherefore
King Darius signed the writing and the decree.</ab>
<ab n="10">¶ Now when
Daniel knew that the writing was signed, hee went into his house,
and his windowes being open in his chamber toward Ierusalem, hee
kneeled vpon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gaue
thankes before his God, as hee did afore time.<note> 1.King.8. 48. , Psal.55. 18.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">Then these men
assembled, and found Daniel praying, and making supplication before
his God.</ab>
<ab n="12">Then they came
neere, and spake before the king concerning the kings decree; Hast
thou not signed a decree, that euery man that shall aske a petition
of any God or man, within thirty dayes, saue of thee, O king,
shalbe cast into the denne of Lions? The king answered and said,
The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians,
which altereth not.</ab>
<ab n="13">Then answered they
and said before the king; That Daniel which is of the captiuity of
the children of Iudah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree
that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a
day.</ab>
<ab n="14">Then the king,
when hee heard these wordes, was sore displeased with himselfe, and
set his heart on Daniel to deliuer him: and he laboured till the
going downe of the sunne, to deliuer him.</ab>
<ab n="15">Then these men
assembled vnto the king, and said vnto the king, Know O king, that
the law of the Medes and Persians is, that no decree nor statute
which the king establisheth, may bee changed.</ab>
<ab n="16">Then the king
commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the denne of
Lions: now the king spake and saide vnto Daniel; Thy God, whom thou
seruest continually, he will deliuer thee.</ab>

<fw>Daniel deliuered.</fw>
<ab n="17">And a stone was
brought and laid vpon the mouth of the denne, and the King sealed
it with his owne signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the
purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.</ab>
<ab n="18">¶ Then the
king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were
instruments of musicke brought before him, and his sleepe went from
him.<note> Or, table.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">Then the king
arose very early in the morning, and went in haste vnto the den of
Lyons.</ab>
<ab n="20">And when he came
to the den, he cryed with a lamentable voice vnto Daniel, and the
king spake and said to Daniel: O Daniel, seruant of the liuing God,
Is thy God whom thou seruest continually, able to deliuer thee from
the Lyons?</ab>
<ab n="21">Then said Daniel
vnto the king, O king, liue for euer.</ab>
<ab n="22">My God hath sent
his Angel, and hath shut the lyons mouthes that they haue not hurt
me: forasmuch as before him, innocencie was found in me; and also
before thee, O king, haue I done no hurt.</ab>
<ab n="23">Then was the king
exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel
vp out of the denne: so Daniel was taken vp out of the den, and no
maner of hurt was found vpon him, because he beleeued in his
God.</ab>
<ab n="24">¶ And the
king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused
Daniel, and they cast them into the den of Lyons, them, their
children, and their wiues: and the Lyons had the mastery of them,
and brake all their bones in pieces or euer they came at the
bottome of the den.</ab>
<ab n="25">¶ Then king
Darius wrote vnto all people, nations, and languages that dwell in
all the earth; Peace be multiplied vnto you.</ab>
<ab n="26">I make a decree,
That in euery dominion of my kingdome, men tremble and feare before
the God of Daniel: for he is the liuing God, and stedfast for euer,
and his kingdome that, which shal not be destroyed, and his
dominion shall be euen vnto the end.<note> Cha.2.44. and 4.3. and 7.14, 27. luke 1.33.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">He deliuereth and
rescueth, and he worketh signes and wonders in heauen and in earth:
who hath deliuered Daniel from the power of the lyons.<note> Heb. hand.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">So this Daniel
prospered in the reigne of Darius, and in the reigne of Cyrus the
Persian.<note> Cha.1.22.</note></ab>
