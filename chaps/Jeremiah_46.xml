<head>1 Ieremiah prophesieth the ouerthrow

chastisement.</head>

<ab n="1">The word of the
Lord which came to Ieremiah the Prophet, against the
Gentiles,</ab>
<ab n="2">Against Egypt,
against the armie of Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt, which was by the
riuer Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchad-rezzar king of
Babylon smote in the fourth yeere of Iehoiakim the son of Iosiah
king of Iudah.</ab>
<ab n="3">Order ye the
buckler and shield, and draw neere to battell.</ab>
<ab n="4">Harnesse the
horses, and get vp ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets,
furbish the speares, and put on the brigandines.</ab>
<ab n="5">Wherefore haue I
seene them dismaid, and turned away backe? and their mightie ones
are beaten downe, &amp; are fled apace, and looke not back: for
feare was round about, saith the Lord.<note> Heb. broken in pieces , Heb. fled a flight.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">Let not the
swift flee away, nor the mightie man escape: they shal stumble and
fall toward the North by the riuer Euphrates.</ab>
<ab n="7">Who is this that
cōmeth vp as a flood, whose waters are moued as
þe riuers?</ab>
<ab n="8">Egypt riseth vp
like a flood, and his waters are moued like the riuers, and he
saith, I wil goe vp, and will couer the earth, I will destroy the
citie and the inhabitants thereof.</ab>
<ab n="9">Come vp ye
horses, and rage yee charets, and let the mightie men come forth,
the Ethiopians and the Libyans that handle the shield, and the
Lydians that handle and bend the bow.<note> Heb. Cush. , Hebr. Put.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">For this is the
day of the Lord God of hostes, a day of vengeance, that he may
auenge him of his aduersaries: and the sword shal deuoure, and it
shall be satiate, and made drunke with their blood: for the Lord
God of hosts hath a sacrifice in the North countrey by the riuer
Euphrates.</ab>
<ab n="11">Goe vp into
Gilead, and take balme, O virgine, the daughter of Egypt: in vaine
shalt thou vse many medicines: for thou shalt not be
cured.<note> Hebr. no cure shalbe vnto thee.</note></ab>

<fw>Against Egypt, and the
Philistines.</fw>
<ab n="12">The nations
haue heard of thy shame, and thy crie hath filled the land: for the
mightie man hath stumbled against the mightie, and they are fallen
both together.</ab>
<ab n="13">¶ The word
that the Lord spake to Ieremiah the Prophet, how Nebuchadrezzar
King of Babylon should come &amp; smite the land of Egypt.</ab>
<ab n="14">Declare ye in
Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph, and in
Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shal
deuoure round about thee.</ab>
<ab n="15">Why are thy
valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the Lord did driue
them.</ab>
<ab n="16">He made many to
fall, yea one fell vpon another, and they said, Arise, and let vs
goe againe to our owne people, and to the land of our natiuitie,
from the oppressing sword.<note> Hebr. multiplied the faller.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">They did crie
there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise, he hath passed the
time appointed.</ab>
<ab n="18">As I liue,
saith the King, whose Name is the Lord of hostes, Surely as Tabor
is among the mountaines, and as Carmel by the Sea, so shall hee
come.</ab>
<ab n="19">Oh thou
daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thy selfe to goe into
captiuitie: for Noph shalbe waste and desolate without an
inhabitant.<note> Heb. make thee instruments of captiuitie.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">Egypt is like a
very faire heifer, but destruction commeth: it commeth out of the
North.</ab>
<ab n="21">Also her hired
men are in the midst of her, like fatted bullocks, for they also
are turned backe, and are fled away together; they did not stand,
because the day of their calamitie was come vpon them, and the time
of their visitation.<note> Hebr. bullocks of the stall.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">The voice
thereof shall goe like a serpent, for they shall march with an
armie, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.</ab>
<ab n="23">They shall cut
downe her forrest, saith the Lord, though it cannot be searched,
because they are more then the grashoppers, and are
innumerable.</ab>
<ab n="24">The daughter of
Egypt shalbe confounded, she shalbe deliuered into the hand of the
people of the North.</ab>
<ab n="25">The Lord of
hostes the God of Israel saith, Behold, I will punish the multitude
of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings,
euen Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him.<note> Or, nourisher. Heb. Amon.</note></ab>

<fw>Against Egypt, and the
Philistines.</fw>
<ab n="26">And I will
deliuer them into the hand of those that seeke their liues, and
into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand
of his seruants, and afterwards it shalbe inhabited, as in the
dayes of old, saith the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="27">¶ But
feare not thou, O my seruant Iacob, and be not dismaied, O Israel:
for behold, I will saue thee from afarre off, and thy seed from the
land of their captiuitie, and Iacob shall returne and be in rest
and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.<note> Isai.41. 13. and 43. 5. and 44.1. cha.30.10.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">Feare thou not,
O Iacob my seruant, saith the Lord, for I am with thee, for I will
make a full end of all the nations whither I haue driuen thee, but
I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in measure,
yet will I not leaue thee wholly vnpunished.<note> Chap. 30. 11. and 10. 24. , Or, not vtterly cut thee off.</note></ab>
