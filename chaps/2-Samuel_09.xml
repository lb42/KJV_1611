<head>CHAP. IX.</head>
<head>1 Dauid by Ziba, sendeth for
Mephibosheth. 7 For Ionathans sake he intertaineth him at his
table, and restoreth him all that was Sauls. 9 He maketh Ziba his
farmour.</head>

<ab n="1">And Dauid said,
Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew
him kindnesse for Ionathans sake?</ab>
<ab n="2">And there was of
the house of Saul, a seruant whose name was Ziba: and when they had
called him vnto Dauid, the king said vnto him, Art thou Ziba? And
he said, Thy seruant is he.</ab>

<fw>Dauids kindnesse to
Mephibosheth.</fw>
<ab n="3">And the king
said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew
the kindnesse of God vnto him? and Ziba said vnto the king,
Ionathan hath yet a sonne, which is lame on his feete.<note> Chap. 4. 4.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">And the king
saide vnto him, Where is hee? and Ziba said vnto the king, Behold,
he is in the house of Machir the sonne of Ammiel, in
Lodebar.</ab>
<ab n="5">¶ Then king
Dauid sent, and fet him out of the house of Machir the son of
Ammiel, from Lodebar.</ab>
<ab n="6">Now when
Mephibosheth the sonne of Ionathan the sonne of Saul, was come vnto
Dauid, hee fell on his face, and did reuerence: and Dauid said,
Mephibosheth! And he answered, Behold thy seruant.</ab>
<ab n="7">¶ And Dauid
saide vnto him, Feare not; for I will surely shew thee kindnesse,
for Ionathan thy fathers sake, and will restore thee all the land
of Saul thy father, and thou shalt eate bread at my table
continually.</ab>
<ab n="8">And hee bowed
himselfe, and saide, What is thy seruant, that thou shouldest looke
vpon such a dead dogge as I am?</ab>
<ab n="9">¶ Then the
king called to Ziba Sauls seruant, and said vnto him, I haue giuen
vnto thy masters sonne all that pertained to Saul, and to all his
house.</ab>
<ab n="10">Thou therefore
and thy sonnes, and thy seruants, shall till the land for him, and
thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy masters sonne may haue
food to eate: but Mephibosheth thy masters sonne shall eat bread
alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteene sonnes, and twenty
seruants.</ab>
<ab n="11">Then saide Ziba
vnto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath
commanded his seruant, so shall thy seruant doe: as for
Mephibosheth, said the King, he shall eate at my table, as one of
the kings sonnes.</ab>
<ab n="12">And Mephibosheth
had a yong sonne whose name was Micha: and all that dwelt in the
house of Ziba, were seruants vnto Mephibosheth.</ab>
<ab n="13">So Mephibosheth
dwelt in Ierusalem: for hee did eate continually at the kings
table, and was lame on both his feete.</ab>
