<head>CHAP. II.</head>
<head>1 Hauing shewed the reason why he
came not to them, 6 Hee requireth them to forgiue and to comfort
that excommunicated person, 10 Euen as himselfe also vpon his true
repentance had forgiuen him, 12 declaring withall why hee departed
from Troas to Macedonia, 14 and the happy successe which God gaue
to his preaching in all places.</head>

<ab n="1">But I
determined this with my selfe, that I would not come againe to you
in heauinesse.</ab>
<ab n="2">For if I
make you sorie, who is hee then that maketh mee glad, but the same
which is made sorie by me.</ab>
<ab n="3">And I wrote
this same vnto you, least when I came, I should haue sorrow from
them of whome I ought to reioyce, hauing confidence in you all,
that my ioy is the ioy of you all.</ab>
<ab n="4">For out of
much affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote vnto you with many
teares, not that you should bee grieued, but that yee might knowe
the loue which I haue more abundantly vnto you.</ab>
<ab n="5">But if any
haue caused griefe, hee hath not grieued mee, but in part: that I
may not ouercharge you all.</ab>
<ab n="6">Sufficient
to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of
many.<note> Or, censure</note></ab>
<ab n="7">So that
contrarywise, yee ought rather to forgiue him, and comfort him,
lest perhaps, such a one should be swallowed vp with ouermuch
sorrow.</ab>

<fw>A sweet sauour.</fw>
<ab n="8">Wherefore I
beseech you, that you would confirme your loue towards him.</ab>
<ab n="9">For to this
end also did I write, that I might know the proofe of you, whether
ye be obedient in all things.</ab>
<ab n="10">To whom yee
forgiue any thing, I forgiue also: for if I forgaue any thing, to
whom I forgaue it, for your sakes forgaue I it, in the person of
Christ,<note> Or, in the sight.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">Lest Satan
should get an aduantage of vs: for wee are not ignorant of his
deuices.</ab>
<ab n="12">Furthermore
when I came to Troas, to preach Christs Gospel, and a doore was
opened vnto mee of the Lord,</ab>
<ab n="13">I had no
rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother, but taking
my leaue of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</ab>
<ab n="14">Now thankes
bee vnto God, which alwayes causeth vs to triumph in Christ, and
maketh manifest the sauour of his knowledge by vs in euery
place.</ab>
<ab n="15">For wee are
vnto God, a sweet sauour of Christ, in them that are saued, and in
them that perish.</ab>
<ab n="16">To the one
wee are the sauour of death vnto death; and to the other, the
sauour of life vnto life: and who is sufficient for these
things?</ab>
<ab n="17">For wee are
not as many which corrupt the word of God: but as of sinceritie,
but as of God, in the sight of God speake we in Christ.<note> Or, deale deceitfully with.</note></ab>
