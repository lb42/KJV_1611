<head>CHAP. XX.</head>
<head>1 God refuseth to be consulted by
the Elders of Israel. 5. He sheweth the story of their rebellions
in Egypt, 10 in the wildernes, 27 and in the land. 33 He promiseth
to gather them by the Gospel. 45 Vnder the name of a forest he
sheweth the destruction of Ierusalem.</head>

<ab n="1">And it came to
passe in the seuenth yeere, in the fift moneth, the tenth day of
the moneth, that certaine of the elders of Israel came to enquire
of the Lord, and sate before me.</ab>
<ab n="2">Then came the
word of the Lord vnto me, saying,</ab>
<ab n="3">Sonne of man,
speake vnto the elders of Israel, and say vnto them, Thus saith the
Lord God, Are yee come to enquire of me? As I liue, saith the Lord
God, I will not be enquired of by you.</ab>
<ab n="4">Wilt thou iudge
them, sonne of man, wilt thou iudge them? cause them to know the
abominations of their fathers:<note> Or, plead for them. , Chap. 22. 2. and 23. 36.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">¶ And say
vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, In the day when I chose Israel,
and lifted vp mine hand vnto the seed of the house of Iacob, and
made my selfe knowen vnto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted
vp mine hand vnto them, saying, I am the Lord your God,<note> Or, sware, and so verse 6,&amp;c. , Exod.31. 8. and 4.31.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">In the day that I
lifted vp mine hand vnto them to bring them foorth of the land of
Egypt, into a lande that I had espied for them, flowing with milke
and hony, which is the glory of all lands:</ab>
<ab n="7">Then said I vnto
them, Cast ye away euery man the abominations of his eyes, and
defile not your selues with the idoles of Egypt: I am the Lord your
God.</ab>
<ab n="8">But they rebelled
against me, and would not hearken vnto mee: they did not euery man
cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake
the idoles of Egypt: then I said, I will powre out my furie vpon
them, to accomplish my anger against them in the middest of the
land of Egypt.</ab>
<ab n="9">But I wrought for
my names sake that it should not be polluted before the heathen,
among whom they were, in whose sight I made my selfe knowen vnto
them, in bringing them foorth out of the land of Egypt.</ab>

<fw>The rebellion of Israel.</fw>
<ab n="10">¶ Wherefore
I caused them to goe foorth out of the land of Egypt, and brought
them into the wildernesse.<note> Exod.13. 18.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And I gaue them
my statutes, and shewed them my iudgements, which if a man doe, he
shall euen liue in them.<note> Heb. made them to know. , Leuit. 18. 5. rom.10.5. gal.3.12.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">Moreouer also, I
gaue them my Sabbaths, to be a signe betweene mee and them, that
they might know that I am the Lord that sanctifie them.<note> Exod. 20. 8. and 31. 13,&amp;c. and 35.2. deut.5.12.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">But the house of
Israel rebelled against me in the wildernesse: they walked not in
my statutes, and they despised my iudgements, which if a man doe,
hee shall euen liue in them, and my sabbaths they greatly polluted:
then I said I would powre out my furie vpon them in the
wildernesse, to consume them:<note> Exod. 16. 28. , Numb. 14. 29. and 26. 65.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">But I wrought
for my names sake, that it should not bee polluted before the
heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.</ab>
<ab n="15">Yet also I
lifted vp my hand vnto them in the wildernesse, that I would not
bring them into the land which I had giuen them, flowing with milke
and hony, which is the glory of all lands,</ab>
<ab n="16">Because they
despised my iudgements, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted
my Sabbaths: for their heart went after their idoles.</ab>
<ab n="17">Neuerthelesse,
mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an
end of thē in the wildernes.</ab>
<ab n="18">But I said vnto
their children in the wildernesse; Walke ye not in the statutes of
your fathers, neither obserue their iudgements, nor defile your
selues with their idoles.</ab>
<ab n="19">I am the Lord
your God: walke in my statutes, and keepe my iudgements and doe
them:</ab>
<ab n="20">And hallow my
Sabbaths, and they shall be a signe betweene mee and you, that yee
may know that I am the Lord your God.</ab>
<ab n="21">Notwithstanding
the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes,
neither kept my iudgements to doe them, which if a man doe, hee
shall euen liue in them; they polluted my Sabbaths: then I said I
would powre out my furie vpon them, to accomplish my anger against
them in the wildernesse.</ab>

<fw>Children offered.</fw>
<ab n="22">Neuerthelesse I
withdrew mine hand and wrought for my names sake, that it should
not be polluted in the fight of the heathen, in whose sight I
brought them foorth.</ab>
<ab n="23">I lifted vp mine
hand vnto them also in the wildernesse, that I would scatter them
among the heathen, and disperse them through the countreys;</ab>
<ab n="24">Because they had
not executed my iudgements, but had despised my Statutes, and had
polluted my Sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers
idoles.</ab>
<ab n="25">Wherefore I gaue
them also statutes that were not good, and iudgements whereby they
should not liue.</ab>
<ab n="26">And I polluted
them in their owne gifts, in that they caused to passe through the
fire all that openeth the wombe, that I might make them desolate,
to the end, that they might know that I am the Lord.<note> Chap. 16. 21.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">¶ Therefore
sonne of man, speake vnto the house of Israel, and say vnto them,
Thus saith the Lord God, Yet in this your fathers haue blasphemed
me, in that they haue committed a trespasse against me.<note> Heb. trespassed a trespasse.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">For when I had
brought them into the land, for the which I lifted vp mine hand to
giue it to them, then they saw euery high hill, and all the thicke
trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they
presented the prouocation of their offering: there also they made
their sweet sauour, and powred out there their drinke
offerings.</ab>
<ab n="29">Then I said vnto
them, What is the high place whereunto ye goe? and the name thereof
is called Bamah vnto this day.<note> Or, I told them what the hie place was, or Bamah.</note></ab>
<ab n="30">Wherefore say
vnto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God, Are ye polluted
after the maner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredome after
their abominations?</ab>
<ab n="31">For when yee
offer your gifts, when yee make your sonnes to passe through the
fire, ye pollute your selues with all your idoles euen vnto this
day: and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I
liue, saith the Lord God, I will not be inquired of by you.</ab>
<ab n="32">And that which
cōmeth into your minde, shall not be at all, that ye say, We
wil be as the heathen, as the families of the countreys, to serue
wood and stone.</ab>

<fw>Gods Name.</fw>
<ab n="33">¶ As I
liue, sayeth the Lord God, surely with a mighty hand, and with a
stretched out arme, and with furie powred out, will I rule ouer
you.</ab>
<ab n="34">And I will bring
you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countreys
wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, &amp; with a
stretched out arme, and with fury powred out.</ab>
<ab n="35">And I wil bring
you into the wildernes of the people, and there will I plead with
you face to face.</ab>
<ab n="36">Like as I
pleaded with your fathers in the wildernes of the land of Egypt, so
wil I plead with you, saith the Lord God.</ab>
<ab n="37">And I will cause
you to passe vnder the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of
the Couenant.<note> Or, a deliring.</note></ab>
<ab n="38">And I will purge
out from among you the rebels, and them that transgresse against
mee: I will bring them foorth out of the countrey where they
soiourne, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel, and yee
shall know that I am the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="39">As for you, O
house of Israel, thus saith the Lord God, Goe yee, serue ye euery
one his idoles, and hereafter also, if ye wil not hearken vnto me:
but pollute ye my holy Name no more with your gifts, and with your
idoles.</ab>
<ab n="40">For in mine holy
mountaine, in the mountaine of the height of Israel, saith the Lord
God, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land
serue me: there will I accept them, and there wil I require your
offerings, and the first fruits of your oblations, with all your
holy things.<note> Or, chiefe.</note></ab>
<ab n="41">I will accept
you with your sweet sauour, when I bring you out from the people,
and gather you out of the countreys wherein yee haue bene
scattered, and I wil be sanctified in you before the
heathen.<note> Hebr. sauour of rest.</note></ab>
<ab n="42">And ye shall
know that I am the Lord, when I shall bring you into the land of
Israel, into the countrey for the which I lifted vp mine hand, to
giue it to your fathers.</ab>
<ab n="43">And there shall
yee remember your wayes, &amp; all your doings, wherein ye haue
bene defiled, and ye shal lothe your selues in your owne sight, for
all your euils that ye haue committed.</ab>
<ab n="44">And ye shal know
that I am the Lord, when I haue wrought with you for my Names sake,
not according to your wicked wayes, nor according to your corrupt
doings, O yee house of Israel, saith the Lord God.</ab>

<fw>The sword drawen, and
fourbished.</fw>
<ab n="45">¶ Moreouer,
the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,</ab>
<ab n="46">Sonne of man,
set thy face toward the South, and drop thy word toward the South,
and prophesie against the forrest of the South field.</ab>
<ab n="47">And say to the
forest of þ<note/> South, Heare the word of the Lord:
Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and
it shall deuoure euery greene tree in thee, and euery dry tree: the
flaming flame shal not be quenched, and all faces from the South to
the North shalbe burnt therein.</ab>
<ab n="48">And all flesh
shall see that I the Lord haue kindled it: it shall not be
quenched.</ab>
<ab n="49">Then said I, Ah
Lord God, they say of me, Doeth he not speake parables?</ab>
