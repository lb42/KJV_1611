<fw>Great mourning.</fw>
<ab n="1">The burden of
the word of the Lord for Israel, saith the Lord, which stretcheth
foorth the Heauens, and laith the foundation of the earth, and
formeth the spirit of man within him.</ab>
<ab n="2">Behold, I will
make Ierusalem a cup of trembling vnto all the people round about,
when they shall be in the siege both against Iudah and against
Ierusalem.<note> Or, slumber or poison. , Or, and also against Iudah shall he be which shal be in siege against Ierusalem.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">¶ And in
that day will I make Ierusalem a burdensome stone for all people:
all that burden themselues with it, shall be cut in pieces; though
all the people of the earth bee gathered together against
it.</ab>
<ab n="4">In that day,
saith the Lord, I will smite euery horse with astonishment, and his
rider with madnesse, and I will open mine eyes vpon the house of
Iudah, and will smite euery horse of the people with
blindnesse.</ab>
<ab n="5">And the
gouernours of Iudah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of
Ierusalem shall be my strength in the Lord of hostes their
God.<note> Or, there is strength to me and to the inhabitants, &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">¶ In that
day will I make the gouernours of Iudah like a harth of fire among
the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheafe; and they shall
deuoure all the people round about, on the right hand and on the
left: and Ierusalem shall bee inhabited againe in her owne place,
euen in Ierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="7">The Lord also
shall saue the tents of Iudah first, that the glory of the house of
Dauid, and the glory of the inhabitants of Ierusalem do not
magnifie themselues against Iudah.</ab>
<ab n="8">In that day
shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Ierusalem, and he that is
feeble among them at that day shall be as Dauid; and the house of
Dauid shall be as God, as the Angel of the Lord before
them.<note> Or, abiect. Hebr. fallen.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">¶ And it
shall come to passe in that day, that I will seeke to destroy all
the nations that come against Ierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="10">And I wil
powre vpon the house of Dauid, and vpon the inhabitants of
Ierusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications, and they shall
looke vpon me whom they haue pearced, and they shal mourne for him,
as one mourneth for his onely sonne, and shall be in bitternesse
for him, as one that is in bitternesse for his first
borne.<note> Ioh.19. 34, 37. reuel.1.7.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">In that day
shall there bee a great mourning in Ierusalem, as the mourning of
Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.<note> Acts 2.37. , 2. Chron. 35.22.</note></ab>

<fw>An open fountaine.</fw>
<ab n="12">And the land
shal mourne, euery familie apart, the familie of the house of Dauid
apart, and their wiues apart, the familie of the house of Nathan
apart, and their wiues apart:<note> Heb. families, families.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">The familie of
the house of Leui apart, and their wiues apart: the familie of
Shimei apart, and their wiues apart:</ab>
<ab n="14">All the
families that remaine, euery family apart, &amp; their wiues
apart.</ab>
