<head>CHAP. X.</head>
<head>5 Mardocheus remembreth and
expoundeth his dreame, of the riuer and the two
dragons.</head>

<ab n="4">Then
Mardocheus saide, God hath done these things.</ab>
<ab n="5">For I
remember a dreame, which I sawe concerning these matters, and
nothing thereof hath failed.</ab>
<ab n="6">A
little fountaine became a riuer, and there was light, &amp; the
Sunne, and much water: this riuer is Esther, wh≈ç the King
married and made Queene.</ab>
<ab n="7">And
the two Dragons are I, and Aman.</ab>
<ab n="8">And
the nations were those that were assembled, to destroy the name of
the Iewes.</ab>
<ab n="9">And
my nation is this Israel, which cryed to God and were saued: for
the Lord hath saued his people, and the Lord hath deliuered vs from
all those euils, and God hath wrought signes, and great wonders,
which haue not bin done among the Gentiles.</ab>
<ab n="10">Therefore
hath hee made two lots, one for the people of God, and another for
all the Gentiles.</ab>
<ab n="11">And
these two lots came at the houre, and time, and day of iudgement
before God amongst all nations.</ab>
<ab n="12">So
God remembred his people, and iustified his inheritance.</ab>
<ab n="13">Therefore
those dayes shall be vnto them in the moneth Adar, the foureteenth
and fifteenth day of the same moneth, with an assembly, and ioy,
and with gladnesse, before God, according to the generations for
euer among his people.</ab>
