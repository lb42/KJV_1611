<head>CHAP.
XVII.</head>
<head>3. 4 A woman arayed in purple and
scarlet, with a golden cup in her hand, sitteth vpon the Beast, 5
which is great Babylon the mother of all abominations. 9 The
interpretation of the seuen heads, 12 and the tenne hornes. 8 The
punishment of the whore. 14 The victory of the Lambe.</head>

<ab n="1">And there came
one of the seuen Angels, which had the seuen vials, and talked with
me, saying vnto mee, Come hither, I will shew vnto thee the
iudgement of the great Whore, that sitteth vpon many
waters:</ab>
<ab n="2">With whom the
kings of the earth haue committed fornication, and the inhabiters
of the earth haue beene made drunk with the wine of her
fornication.</ab>
<ab n="3">So he caried
me away in the Spirit into the wildernesse: and I saw a woman sit
vp≈ç a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy,
hauing seuen heads, and ten hornes.</ab>
<ab n="4">And the woman
was arayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold, and
precious stone &amp; pearles, hauing a golden cup in her hand, full
of abominations and filthinesse of her fornication.<note> Gr. gilded.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">And vpon her
forehead was a name written, Mystery, Babylon The Great, The Mother
Of Harlots, And Abominations Of The Earth.<note> Or, fornications.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">And I saw the
woman drunken with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of
the Martyrs of Iesus: and when I saw her, I wondred with great
admiration.</ab>

<fw>Of the beast.</fw>
<ab n="7">And the Angel
saide vnto mee, Wherefore didst thou marueile? I will tell thee the
mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carieth her, which hath
the seuen heads, and ten hornes.</ab>
<ab n="8">The beast that
thou sawest, was, and is not, and shall ascend out of the
bottomlesse pit, and goe into perdition, and they that dwell on the
earth shall wonder, (whose names were not written in the booke of
life from the foundation of the world) when they behold the beast
that was, and is not, and yet is.</ab>
<ab n="9">And here is
the mind which hath wisedome. The seuen heads are seuen mountaines,
on which the woman sitteth.</ab>
<ab n="10">And there are
seuen Kings, fiue are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet
come: and when he commeth, he must continue a short space.</ab>
<ab n="11">And the beast
that was, and is not, euen he is the eighth, &amp; is of the seuen,
and goeth into perdition.</ab>
<ab n="12">And the tenne
hornes which thou sawest, are ten kings, which haue receiued no
kingdom as yet: but receiue power as kings one houre with the
beast.</ab>
<ab n="13">These haue
one minde, and shall giue their power and strength vnto the
beast.</ab>
<ab n="14">These shal
make warre with the Lambe, and the Lambe shal ouercome them: For he
is Lord of Lords, and King of kings, and they that are with him,
are called, &amp; chosen, and faithfull.<note> 1.Tim 6. 15. chap. 19.16.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">And he saith
vnto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are
peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</ab>
<ab n="16">And the ten
hornes which thou sawest vpon the beast, these shall hate the
whore, and shall make her desolate, and naked, and shall eate her
flesh, and burne her with fire.</ab>
<ab n="17">For God hath
put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and giue
their kingdome vnto the beast, vntil the words of God shall be
fulfilled.</ab>
<ab n="18">And the woman
which thou sawest, is that great Citie which reigneth ouer the
kings of the earth.</ab>
