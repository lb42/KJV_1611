<head>CHAP. LI.</head>
<head>1 The seuere iudgement of God
against Babylon, in reuenge of Israel. 59 Ieremiah deliuereth the
booke of this prophecie to Sheraiah, to be cast into Euphrates, in
token of the perpetuall sinking of Babylon.</head>

<ab n="1">Thus saith the
Lord; Behold, I will raise vp against Babylon, and against them
that dwell in the middest of them that rise vp against me, a
destroying wind;<note> Heb. heart.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And will send
vnto Babylon fanners, that shall fanne her, and shall emptie her
land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round
about.</ab>
<ab n="3">Against him that
bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against him that lifteth
himselfe vp in his brigandine; and spare yee not her young men,
destroy yee vtterly all her hoste.</ab>
<ab n="4">Thus the slaine
shall fall in the land of the Caldeans, and they that are thrust
through in her streetes.</ab>

<fw>Fanners sent against Babylon.</fw>
<ab n="5">For Israel hath
not beene forsaken, nor Iudah of his God, of the Lord of hostes;
though their land was filled with sinne against the holy one of
Israel.</ab>
<ab n="6">Flee out of the
middest of Babylon, and deliuer euery man his soule: bee not cut
off in her iniquitie: for this is the time of the Lords vengeance:
he will render vnto her a recompence.<note> Chap.50.8. reu.18.4.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">Babylon hath
beene a golden cup in the Lords hand, that made all the earth
drunken: the nations haue drunken of her wine, therefore the
nations are mad.</ab>
<ab n="8">Babylon is
suddenly fallen and destroyed: howle for her, take balme for her
paine, if so be she may be healed.<note> Isa.21.9. reu.14.8. and 18.2.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">We would haue
healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let vs goe
euery one into his owne countrey: for her iudgement reacheth vnto
heauen, and is lifted vp euen to the skies.</ab>
<ab n="10">The Lord hath
brought forth our righteousnesse: come and let vs declare in Zion
the worke of the Lord our God.</ab>
<ab n="11">Make bright the
arrowes: gather the shields: the Lord hath raised vp the spirit of
the kings of the Medes: for his deuice is against Babylon, to
destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the Lord, the vengeance
of his temple.<note> Heb. pure.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">Set vp the
standart vpon the walles of Babylon, make the watch strong: set vp
the watchman: prepare the ambushes: for the Lord hath both deuised
and done that, which hee spake against the inhabitants of
Babylon.<note> Heb. lyers in waite.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">O thou that
dwellest vpon many waters, abundant in treasures; thine end is
come, and the measure of thy couetousnesse.</ab>
<ab n="14">The Lord of
hostes hath sworne by himselfe, saying, Surely I will fill thee
with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift vp a shoute
against thee.<note> Amos.6.8 , Heb. by his soule. , Heb. vtter.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">Hee hath made
the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his
wisedome, and hath stretched out the heauen by his
vnderstanding.<note> Gen.6.1. 6.chap.10. 12. &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">When he
vttereth his voyce, there is a multitude of waters in the heauens,
and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth, he
maketh lightnings with raine, and bringeth forth the wind out of
his treasures.<note> Or, noise.</note></ab>

<fw>The desolation of Babylon.</fw>
<ab n="17">Euery man is
brutish by his knowledge: euery founder is confounded by the grauen
image: for his moulten image is falsehood, and there is no breath
in them.<note> Chap.10.14. , Or, is more brutish then to know.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">They are
vanitie, the worke of errours: in the time of their visitation they
shall perish.</ab>
<ab n="19">The portion of
Iacob is not like them, for he is the former of all things, and
Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the Lord of hostes is his
Name.<note> Chap.10.16.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">Thou art my
battel-axe and weapons of warre: for with thee will I breake in
pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy
kingdomes;<note> Or, in thee, or by thee.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">And with thee
will I breake in pieces the horse and his rider, and with thee will
I breake in pieces the charet, and his rider;</ab>
<ab n="22">With thee also
will I breake in pieces man and woman, and with thee will I breake
in pieces old and yong, and with thee will I breake in pieces the
yong man and the maide.</ab>
<ab n="23">I will also
breake in pieces with thee, the shepheard and his flocke, and with
thee will I breake in pieces the husbandman, and his yoke of oxen,
and with thee will I breake in pieces Captaines and rulers.</ab>
<ab n="24">And I will
render vnto Babylon, and to all the inhabitants of Caldea, all
their euil that they haue done in Zion in your sight, saith the
Lord.</ab>
<ab n="25">Behold, I am
against thee, O destroying mountaine, saith the Lord, which
destroiest all the earth, and I wil stretch out mine hand vpon
thee, and roule thee downe from the rockes, and will make thee a
burnt mountaine.</ab>
<ab n="26">And they shall
not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations,
but thou shalt be desolate for euer, saith the Lord.<note> Hebr. euerlasting desolations.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">Set ye vp a
standart in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations: prepare
the nations against her: call together against her the kingdomes of
Ararat, Minni, &amp; Ashchenaz: appoint a captaine against her:
cause her horses to come vp as the rough caterpillers.</ab>
<ab n="28">Prepare against
her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captaines thereof,
and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his
dominion.</ab>

<fw>The desolation of Babylon.</fw>
<ab n="29">And the land
shall tremble and sorrow: for euery purpose of the Lord shalbe
performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation
without an inhabitant.</ab>
<ab n="30">The mightie men
of Babylon haue forborne to fight: they haue remained in their
holdes: their might hath failed, they became as women: they haue
burnt their dwelling places: her barres are broken.</ab>
<ab n="31">One poste shall
runne to meet another, and one messenger to meete another, to shew
the king of Babylon that his citie is taken at one end,</ab>
<ab n="32">And that the
passages are stopped, and the reedes they haue burnt with fire, and
the men of warre are afrighted.</ab>
<ab n="33">For thus saith
the Lord of hostes, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon is
like a threshing floore; it is time to thresh her: yet a little
while, and the time of her haruest shall come.<note> Or, in the time that he thresheth her.</note></ab>
<ab n="34">Nebuchadrezzar
the king of Babylon hath deuoured me, he hath crushed me; he hath
made me an emptie vessell: hee hath swallowed mee vp like a dragon;
he hath filled his bellie with my delicates, he hath cast me
out.</ab>
<ab n="35">The violence
done to me and to my flesh, be vpon Babylon, shall the inhabitant
of Zion say; and my blood vpon the inhabitants of Caldea, shall
Ierusalem say.<note> Hebr. my violence. , Or, remainder. , Hebr. inhabitresse.</note></ab>
<ab n="36">Therefore thus
saith the Lord, Behold, I wil plead thy cause, and take vengeance
for thee, and I will drie vp her sea, and make her springs
drie.</ab>
<ab n="37">And Babylon
shal become heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, an astonishment,
and an hissing without an inhabitant.</ab>
<ab n="38">They shall
roare together like lions; they shall yell as lions
whelps.<note> Or, shake themselues.</note></ab>
<ab n="39">In their heat I
will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may
reioyce, and sleepe a perpetuall sleepe, and not wake, saith the
Lord.</ab>
<ab n="40">I will bring
them downe like lambes to the slaughter, like rammes with hee
goates.</ab>
<ab n="41">How is Sheshach
taken? and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised? how is
Babylon become an astonishment among the nations?</ab>
<ab n="42">The sea is come
vp vpon Babylon: she is couered with the multitude of the waues
thereof.</ab>

<fw>Bels vomit. The booke drowned.</fw>
<ab n="43">Her cities are
a desolation, a dry land and a wildernes, a land wherein no man
dwelleth, neither doeth any sonne of man passe thereby.</ab>
<ab n="44">And I will
punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that
which he hath swallowed vp, and the nations shall not flow together
any more vnto him, yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.</ab>
<ab n="45">My people, goe
ye out of the midst of her, and deliuer ye euery man his soule
fr≈ç the fierce anger of the Lord,</ab>
<ab n="46">And lest your
heart faint, and ye feare for the rumour that shall be heard in the
land: a rumour shall both come one yeere, and after that in another
yeere shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against
ruler.</ab>
<ab n="47">Therefore
behold, the dayes come, that I will doe iudgment vpon the grauen
images of Babylon, and her whole land shall bee confounded, and all
her slaine shall fall in the midst of her.<note> Heb. visit vpon.</note></ab>
<ab n="48">Then the heauen
and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for Babylon: for
the spoilers shall come vnto her from the North, saith the
Lord.</ab>
<ab n="49">As Babylon hath
caused the slaine of Israel to fall: so at Babylon shall fall the
slaine of all the earth.<note> Or, both Babylon is to fall, O ye slaine of Israel, &amp; with Babylon, &amp;c. , Or, the countrey.</note></ab>
<ab n="50">Ye that haue
escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the Lord
afarre off: and let Ierusalem come into your mind.</ab>
<ab n="51">We are
confounded, because wee haue heard reproch, shame hath couered our
faces: for strangers are come into the Sanctuaries of the Lords
house.</ab>
<ab n="52">Wherfore
behold, the dayes come, saith the Lord, that I will do iudgment
vpon her grauen images, and through all her land the wounded shall
grone.</ab>
<ab n="53">Though Babylon
should mount vp to heauen, and though shee should fortifie the
height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come vnto her,
saith the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="54">A sound of a
crie commeth from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of
the Caldeans.</ab>
<ab n="55">Because the
Lord hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voyce
when her waues doe roare like great waters, a noise of their voice
is vttered.</ab>

<fw>The booke drowned.</fw>
<ab n="56">Because the
spoiler is come vpon her, euen vpon Babylon, and her mightie men
are taken, euery one of their bowes is broken, for the Lord God of
recompenses shall surely requite.</ab>
<ab n="57">And I will make
drunke her princes and her wise men, her captaines and her rulers,
and her mightie men: and they shall sleepe a perpetuall sleepe, and
not wake, saith the king, whose Name is the Lord of hosts.</ab>
<ab n="58">Thus saith the
Lord of hosts, The broad walles of Babylon shalbe vtterly broken,
and her high gates shal be burnt with fire, and the people shall
labour in vaine, and the folke in the fire, and they shall be
weary.<note> Or, the walles of broad Babylon. , Or, made naked.</note></ab>
<ab n="59">¬∂ The word
which Ieremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the sonne of Neriah,
the sonne of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Iudah
into Babylon, in the fourth yeere of his reigne, and this Seraiah
was a quiet prince.<note> Or, on the behalfe of. , Or, prince of Menucha or chiefe chamberlaine.</note></ab>
<ab n="60">So Ieremiah
wrote in a booke all the euill that should come vpon Babylon: euen
all these wordes that are written against Babylon.</ab>
<ab n="61">And Ieremiah
said to Seraiah, When thou commest to Babylon, and shalt see, and
shalt read all these words,</ab>
<ab n="62">Then shalt thou
say, O Lord, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off,
that none shall remaine in it, neither man nor beast, but that it
shalbe desolate for euer.<note> Heb. desolations.</note></ab>
<ab n="63">And it shall
bee when thou hast made an end of reading this booke, that thou
shalt binde a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of
Euphrates.</ab>
<ab n="64">And thou shalt
say, Thus shall Babylon sinke, and shall not rise from the euill
that I will bring vpon her: and they shall be wearie. Thus farre
are the words of Ieremiah.</ab>
