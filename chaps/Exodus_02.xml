she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrewes
children.</ab>

daughter said to her, Goe: And the mayd went and called the childs
mother.</ab>
<ab n="9">And Pharaohs

the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</ab>
<ab n="13">And when he went
out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrewes stroue
together: And hee said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest
thou thy fellow?</ab>
<ab n="14">And he said, Who
made thee a Prince and a iudge ouer vs? intendest thou to kill me,

this thing is knowen.<note> Hebr. a Man a Prince.</note></ab>
