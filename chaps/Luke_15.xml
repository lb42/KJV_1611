<head>CHAP. XV.</head>
<head>1 The parable of the lost sheep: 8
Of the piece of siluer: 11 Of the prodigall sonne.</head>

<ab n="1">Then drew
neere vnto him all the Publicanes and sinners, for to heare
him.</ab>

<fw>The lost sheepe, and prodigall
sonne.</fw>
<ab n="2">And the
Pharises and Scribes murmured, murmured, saying, This man receiueth
sinners, and eateth with them.</ab>
<ab n="3">¶ And he
spake this parable vnto them, saying,</ab>
<ab n="4">What man of
you hauing an hundred sheepe, if he loose one of them, doth not
leaue the ninety and nine in the wildernesse, and goe after that
which is lost, vntill he find it?<note> Matth. 18 12.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">And when he
hath found it, hee layeth it on his shoulders, reioycing.</ab>
<ab n="6">And when he
commeth home, he calleth together his friends, and neighbours,
saying vnto them, Reioyce with me, for I haue found my sheepe which
was lost.</ab>
<ab n="7">I say vnto
you, that likewise ioy shall be in heauen ouer one sinner that
repenteth, more then ouer ninety and nine iust persons, which need
no repentance.</ab>
<ab n="8">¶ Either
what woman hauing ten pieces of siluer, if she lose one piece, doth
not light a candle, and sweepe the house, and seeke diligently till
shee find it?<note> Drachma heere translated a piece of silver, is the eight part of an ounce which commeth to seven pence halfe penie, and is equall to the Romane penie, Mat. 18. 28</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And when she
hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together,
saying, Reioyce with me, for I haue found þe piece
which I had lost.</ab>
<ab n="10">Likewise I say vnto
you, there is ioy in the presence of the Angels of God, ouer one
sinner that repenteth.</ab>
<ab n="11">¶ And hee
said, A certaine man had two sonnes:</ab>
<ab n="12">And the yonger of
them said to his father, Father, giue me the portion of goods that
falleth to me. And he diuided vnto them his liuing.</ab>
<ab n="13">And not many dayes
after, the yonger sonne gathered al together, and tooke his iourney
into a farre countrey, and there wasted his substance with riotous
liuing.</ab>
<ab n="14">And when he had
spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land, and he beganne
to be in want.</ab>
<ab n="15">And he went and
ioyned himselfe to a citizen of that countrey, and he sent him into
his fields to feed swine.</ab>
<ab n="16">And he would faine
haue filled his belly with the huskes that the swine did eate:
&amp; no man gaue vnto him.</ab>
<ab n="17">And when he came to
himselfe, he said, How many hired seruants of my fathers haue bread
inough and to spare, and I perish with hunger?</ab>

<fw>The lost sheepe, and prodigall
sonne.</fw>
<ab n="18">I will arise and
goe to my father, and will say vnto him, Father, I haue sinned
against heauen and before thee.</ab>
<ab n="19">And am no more
worthy to be called thy sonne: make me as one of thy hired
seruants.</ab>
<ab n="20">And he arose and
came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father
saw him, and had compassion, and ranne, and fell on his necke, and
kissed him.</ab>
<ab n="21">And the sonne said
vnto him, Father, I haue sinned against heauen, and in thy sight,
and am no more worthy to be called thy sonne.</ab>
<ab n="22">But the father
saide to his seruants, Bring foorth the best robe, and put it on
him, and put a ring on his hand, and shooes on his feete.</ab>
<ab n="23">And bring hither
the fatted calfe, and kill it, and let vs eate and be
merrie.</ab>
<ab n="24">For this my sonne
was dead, and is aliue againe; hee was lost, &amp; is found. And
they began to be merie.</ab>
<ab n="25">Now his elder sonne
was in the field, and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he
heard musicke &amp; dauncing,</ab>
<ab n="26">And he called one
of the seruants, and asked what these things meant.</ab>
<ab n="27">And he said vnto
him, Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatted
calfe, because he hath receiued him safe and sound.</ab>
<ab n="28">And he was angry,
and would not goe in: therefore came his father out, and intreated
him.</ab>
<ab n="29">And he answering
said to his father, Loe, these many yeeres doe I serue thee,
neither transgressed I at any time thy commandement, and yet thou
neuer gauest mee a kid, that I might make merry with my
friends:</ab>
<ab n="30">But as soone as
this thy sonne was come, which hath deuoured thy liuing with
harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calfe.</ab>
<ab n="31">And he said vnto
him, Sonne, thou art euer with me, and all that I haue is
thine.</ab>
<ab n="32">It was meete that
we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead,
and is aliue againe: and was lost, and is found.</ab>
