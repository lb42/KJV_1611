<head>CHAP. I.</head>
<head>1 Vnto Habakkuk complaining of the
iniquitie of the land, 5 is shewed the fearefull vengeance by the
Caldeans. 12 Hee complaineth, that vengeance should be executed by
them who are farre worse.</head>

<ab n="1">The burden which
Habakkuk þe Prophet did see.</ab>
<ab n="2">O Lord, howe long
shall I crie, and thou wilt not heare! euen cry out vnto thee of
violence, and thou wilt not saue?</ab>
<ab n="3">Why doest thou
shew me iniquity, &amp; cause me to behold grieuance? for spoiling
and violence are before me: &amp; there are that raise vp strife
and contention.</ab>
<ab n="4">Therefore the
Lawe is slacked, and iudgement doeth neuer goe foorth: for the
wicked doeth compasse about the righteous: therfore wrong iudgement
proceedeth.<note> Iob 21.7. iere.12.1. , Or, wrested.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">¶ Behold ye
among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marueilously: for I wil
worke a worke in your daies, which yee will not beleeue, though it
be tolde you.<note> Actes 13. 41.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">For loe, I raise
vp the Caldeans, that bitter and hastie nation, which shall march
through the breadth of the land, to possesse the dwelling places
that are not theirs.<note> Hebr. breadths.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">They are terrible
and dreadfull: their iudgement and their dignity shal proceed of
themselues.<note> Or, from them shall proceed the iudgement of these, and the captiuity of these.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Their horses also
are swifter then the leopards, and are more fierce then the euening
wolues: &amp; their horsemen shall spread themselues, and their
horsemen shall come from farre, they shall flie as the Eagle that
hasteth to eate.<note> Heb. sharp. , Zeph.3.3.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">They shall come
all for violence: their faces shall sup vp as the East winde, and
they shall gather the captiuitie as the sand.<note> Heb. the supping vp of their faces, &amp;c. Or, their faces shall looke toward the East: Heb. the opposition of their faces toward the East.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">And they shal
scoffe at the Kings, and the Princes shall bee a scorne vnto them:
they shall deride euery strong holde, for they shall heape dust
&amp; take it.</ab>
<ab n="11">Then shall his
minde change, and he shall passe ouer, and offend, imputing this
his power vnto his God.</ab>
<ab n="12">¶ Art thou
not from euerlasting, O Lord my God, mine Holy one? we shall not
die: O Lord, thou hast ordained them for iudgement, and O mightie
God, thou hast established them for correction.<note> Heb. rocke. , Heb. founded.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Thou art of
purer eyes then to beholde euill, and canst not looke on
ininquitie: wherefore lookest thou vpon them that deale
treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked deuoureth the
man that is more righteous then hee?<note> Or, grieuance.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And makest men
as the fishes of the Sea, as the creeping things, that haue no
ruler ouer them.<note> Or, moouing.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">They take vp all
of them with the angle: they catch them in their net, and gather
them in their dragge; therefore they reioyce and are
glad.<note> Or, flue-net</note></ab>
<ab n="16">Therefore they
sacrifice vnto their net, and burne incense vnto their drag:
because by them their portion is fat, and their meat
plenteous.<note> Or, daintie: Heb. fat.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">Shall they
therefore emptie their net, and not spare continually to slay the
nations?</ab>
