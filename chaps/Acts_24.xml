<head>CHAP.
XXIV.</head>
<head>1 Paul being accused by Tertullus
the Oratour, 10 answereth for his life and doctrine. 24 He
preacheth Christ to the gouernour and his wife. 26 The gouernour
hopeth for a bribe, but in vaine. 27 At last, going out of his
office, hee leaueth Paul in prison.</head>


<fw>Of Tertullus.</fw>
<ab n="1">And after fiue
dayes, Ananias the hie Priest descended with the Elders, and with a
certaine Oratour named Tertullus, who enformed the gouernour
against Paul.</ab>
<ab n="2">And when he
was called foorth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing
that by thee we enioy great quietnesse, and that very worthy deeds
are done vnto this natiō by thy prouidence:</ab>
<ab n="3">Wee accept it
alwayes, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all
thankfulnesse.</ab>
<ab n="4">Notwithstanding,
that I be not farther tedious vnto thee, I pray thee, that thou
wouldest heare vs of thy clemencie a few words.</ab>
<ab n="5">For we haue
found this man a pestilent fellow, and a moouer of sedition among
all the Iewes throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of
the Nazarenes.</ab>
<ab n="6">Who also hath
gone about to profane the Temple: whom we tooke, and would haue
iudged according to our lawe.</ab>
<ab n="7">But the chiefe
captaine Lysias came vpon vs, and with great violence tooke him
away out of our hands:</ab>
<ab n="8">Commanding his
accusers to come vnto thee, by examining of whom thy selfe mayest
take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.</ab>
<ab n="9">And the Iewes
also assented, saying that these things were so.</ab>
<ab n="10">Then Paul, after
that the gouernour had beckened vnto him to speake, answered,
Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many yeeres a Iudge vnto
this nation, I do the more cheerefully answere for my
selfe:</ab>
<ab n="11">Because that thou
mayest vnderstand, that there are yet but twelue dayes, since I
went vp to Hierusalem for to worship.</ab>
<ab n="12">And they neither
found me in the Temple disputing with any man, neither raising vp
the people, neither in the Synagogues, nor in the citie:</ab>
<ab n="13">Neither can they
proue the things whereof they now accuse me.</ab>

<fw>Felix trembleth.</fw>
<ab n="14">But this I confesse
vnto thee, that after the way which they call heresie, so worship I
the God of my fathers, beleeuing all things which are written in
the Law and the Prophets,</ab>
<ab n="15">And haue hope
towards God, which they themselues also allow, that there shall be
a resurrection of the dead, both of the iust and vniust.</ab>
<ab n="16">And herein doe I
exercise my selfe to haue alwayes a conscience void of offence
toward God, and toward men.</ab>
<ab n="17">Now after many
yeeres, I came to bring almes to my nation, &amp; offrings:</ab>
<ab n="18">Wherupon certaine
Iewes from Asia found me purified in the Temple, neither with
multitude, nor with tumult:<note> Chap. 21. 27.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">Who ought to haue
beene here before thee, and obiect, if they had ought against
me.</ab>
<ab n="20">Or else let these
same here say, if they haue found any euill doing in mee, while I
stood before the Councill,</ab>
<ab n="21">Except it be for
this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the
resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this
day.<note> Chap. 23. 6.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">And when Felix
heard these things, hauing more perfect knowledge of that way, he
deferred them and said, When Lysias the chiefe captaine shall come
downe, I will know the vttermost of your matter.</ab>
<ab n="23">And he commanded a
Centurion to keepe Paul, and to let him haue libertie, and that he
should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister, or come vnto
him.</ab>
<ab n="24">And after certaine
dayes, when Felix came with his wife Orusilla, which was a Iew, he
sent for Paul, and heard him cōcerning the faith in
Christ.</ab>
<ab n="25">And as he reasoned
of righteousnesse, temperance, and iudgement to come, Felix
trembled and answered, Go thy way for this time, when I haue a
conuenient season, I will call for thee.</ab>
<ab n="26">He hoped also that
money should haue bene giuen him of Paul, that hee might loose him:
wherefore hee sent for him the oftner, and cōmuned with
him.</ab>
<ab n="27">But after two
yeeres, Portius Festus came into Felix roome: and Felix willing to
shew the Iewes a pleasure, left Paul bound.</ab>
