<head>CHAP.
VII.</head>
<head>1 A reproofe of manifold sinnes. 11
Gods wrath against them for their hypocrisie.</head>

<ab n="1">When I would
haue healed Israel, then the iniquitie of Ephraim was discouered,
and the wickednesse of Samaria: for they commit falsehood: and the
thiefe commeth in, and the troupe of robbers spoileth
without.<note> Hebr. euils. , Hebr. strippeth.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And they
consider not in their hearts that I remember al their wickednesse:
now their owne doings haue beset them about, they are before my
face.<note> Hebr. say not to.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">They make the
king glad with their wickednesse, and the princes with their
lies.</ab>
<ab n="4">They are al
adulterers, as an ouen heated by the baker: who ceaseth from
raising after he hath kneaded the dough, vntill it be
leauened.<note> Or, the raiser wil cease. , Or, from waking.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">In the day of
our King, the princes haue made him sicke with bottels of wine, he
stretched out his hand with scorners.<note> Or, with he at through wine.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">For they haue
made ready their heart like an ouen, whiles they lie in wait: their
baker sleepeth all the night, in the morning it burneth as a
flaming fire.<note> Or, applied.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">They are all
hot as an ouen, and haue deuoured their Iudges; all their Kings are
fallen, there is none among them that calleth vnto me.</ab>
<ab n="8">Ephraim, he
hath mixed himselfe among the people, Ephraim is a cake not
turned.</ab>

<fw>The calfe of Samaria.</fw>
<ab n="9">Strangers haue
deuoured his strength, and hee knoweth it not: yea, gray haires are
here and there vpon him, yet he knoweth not.<note> Heb. sprinkled.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">And the pride of
Israel testifieth to his face, and they doe not returne to the Lord
their God, nor seeke him for all this.<note> Cha.5.5.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">Â¶ Ephraim also
is like a silly doue, without heart: they call to Egypt; they goe
to Assyria.</ab>
<ab n="12">When they shall
goe, I wil spread my net vpon them, I will bring them downe as the
foules of the heauen: I will chastise them as their congregation
hath heard.</ab>
<ab n="13">Woe vnto them, for
they haue fled from me: destruction vnto them, because they haue
transgressed against me, though I haue redeemed them, yet they haue
spoken lies against me.<note> Heb. spoile.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And they haue not
cryed vnto me with their heart, when they howled vpon their beds:
they assemble themselues for corne and wine, and they rebell
against me.</ab>
<ab n="15">Though I haue
bound, and strengthened their armes, yet doe they imagine mischiefe
against me.<note> Or, chastened.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">They returne, but
not to the most High: they are like a deceitfull bow: their princes
shall fall by the sword, for the rage of their tongue: this shall
be their derision in the land of Egypt.<note> Psal.73.9.</note></ab>
