<head>CHAP.
III.</head>
<head>1 Ezekiel eateth the roule. 4 God
encourageth him. 15 God sheweth him the rule of prophecie. 22 God
shutteth and openeth the Prophets mouth.</head>

<ab n="1">Moreouer he said
vnto me, Sonne of man, eate that thou findest: eate this roule, and
goe, speake vnto the house of Israel.</ab>
<ab n="2">So I opened my
mouth, and hee caused me to eate that roule.</ab>

<fw>A roule eaten.</fw>
<ab n="3">And he said vuto
mee; Sonne of man, cause thy belly to eate, and fill thy bowels
with this roule that I giue thee. Then did I eate it, and it was in
my mouth as honie for sweetnesse.<note> Reu. 10.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">¶ And he said
vnto me, Sonne of man, goe, get thee vnto the house of Israel, and
speake with my words vnto them.</ab>
<ab n="5">For thou art not
sent to a people of a strange speech, and of an hard language, but
to the house of Israel.<note> Heb. deepe of lippes and heauie of tongue, and so ver. 6.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">Not to many people
of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst
not vnderstand: surely had I sent thee to them, they would haue
hearkened vnto thee:<note> Heb. deepe of lip, and heauie language. , Or, if I had sent thee &amp;c. would they not haue hearkened vnto thee?</note></ab>
<ab n="7">But the house of
Israel will not hearken vnto thee; for they will not hearken vnto
me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hard
hearted.<note> Heb. stiffe of forhead and hard of heart.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Behold, I haue
made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong
against their foreheads.</ab>
<ab n="9">As an adamant
harder then flint haue I made thy forehead: feare them not, neither
be dismayed at their lookes, though they be a rebellious
house.<note> Ier.1.8.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">Moreouer he said
vnto me, Sonne of man, all my words that I shall speake vnto thee,
receiue in thine heart, and heare with thine eares.</ab>
<ab n="11">And goe, get thee
to them of the captiuity, vnto thy people, and speake vnto them and
tell them, Thus saith the Lord God, whether they will heare, or
whether they will forbeare.</ab>
<ab n="12">Then the spirit
tooke me vp, and I heard behind me a voyce of a great rushing,
saying Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place.</ab>
<ab n="13">I heard also the
noise of the wings of the liuing creatures that touched one
another, and the noise of the wheeles ouer against them, and a
noise of a great rushing.<note> Heb. kissed.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">So the spirit
lifted me vp, and tooke me away, and I went in bitternesse, in the
heate of my spirit, but the hand of the Lord was strong vpon
mee.<note> Heb. bitter. , Heb. hot anger.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">¶ Then I
came to them of the captiuity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the riuer
of Chebar, and I sate where they sate, and remained there
astonished among them seuen daies.</ab>

<fw>Watchmens dutie.</fw>
<ab n="16">And it came to
passe at the end of seuen dayes, that the word of the Lord came
vnto me, saying;</ab>
<ab n="17">Sonne of man, I
haue made thee a watchman vnto the house of Israel: therefore heare
the word at my mouth, &amp; giue them warning from me.<note> Chap.33.7</note></ab>
<ab n="18">When I say vnto
the wicked; Thou shalt surely die, and thou giuest him not warning,
nor speakest to warne the wicked from his wicked way to saue his
life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquitie: but his blood
will I require at thine hand.</ab>
<ab n="19">Yet if thou warne
the wicked, and he turne not from his wickednesse, nor from his
wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast deliuered
thy soule.</ab>
<ab n="20">Againe, when a
righteous man doth turne from his righteousnesse and commit
iniquity, and I lay a stumbling blocke before him, he shall die:
because thou hast not giuen him warning, he shall die in his sinne,
and his righteousnesse which he hath done shal not be remembred:
but his blood will I require at thine hand.<note> Chap. 18. 24. , Heb. righteousnesses.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">Neuerthelesse if
thou warne the righteous man, that the righteous sinne not, and he
doth not sinne; he shall surely liue, because he is warned: also
thou hast deliuered thy soule.</ab>
<ab n="22">¶ And the
hand of the Lord was there vpon me, and he said vnto me; Arise, goe
forth into the plaine, and I will there talke with thee.</ab>
<ab n="23">Then I arose and
went forth into the plaine, and behold, the glory of the Lord stood
there as the glory which I saw by the riuer of Chebar, and I fell
on my face.<note> Chap. 1.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">Then the spirit
entred into me, and set me vpon my feet, and spake with me, and
said vnto me, Goe shut thy selfe within thine house.</ab>
<ab n="25">But thou, O sonne
of man, behold, they shall put bands vpon thee, and shall bind thee
with them, and thou shalt not goe out among them.</ab>
<ab n="26">And I will make
thy tongue cleaue to the roofe of thy mouth, that thou shalt be
dumme and shalt not be to them a reprouer: for they are a
rebellious house.<note> A man reprouing.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">But when I speake
with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say vnto them;
Thus saith the Lord God, He that heareth, let him heare, and he
that forbeareth, let him forbeare: for they are a rebellious
house.</ab>
