<head>CHAP.
XVII.</head>
<head>1 Paul preacheth at Thessalonica, 4
where some beleeue, and others persecute him. 10 Hee is sent to
Berea, and preacheth there. 13 Being persecuted at Thessalonica, 15
hee commeth to Athens, and disputeth, and preacheth the liuing God
to them vnknowen, 34 whereby many are conuerted vnto
Christ.</head>

<ab n="1">Now when they
had passed thorow Amphipolis, and Apollonia, they came to
Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Iewes.</ab>
<ab n="2">And Paul, as
his maner was, went in vnto them, and three Sabbath dayes reasoned
with them out of the Scriptures,</ab>
<ab n="3">Opening and
alleadging, that Christ must needs haue suffered and risen againe
from the dead: and that this Iesus whom I preach vnto you, is
Christ.</ab>
<ab n="4">And some of
them beleeued, and consorted with Paul and Silas: and of the deuout
Greekes a great multitude, and of the chiefe women not a
few.</ab>

<fw>Scriptures searched.</fw>
<ab n="5">¶ But the
Iewes which beleeued not, mooued with enuie, tooke vnto them
certaine lewd fellowes of the baser sort, and gathered a company,
and set all the citie on an vprore, and assaulted the house of
Iason, and sought to bring them out to the people.</ab>
<ab n="6">And when they
found them not, they drew Iason, and certaine brethren vnto the
rulers of the citie, crying, These that haue turned the world
vpside downe, are come hither also,</ab>
<ab n="7">Whom Iason
hath receiued: and these all doe contrary to the decrees of Cesar,
saying, that there is another King, one Iesus.</ab>
<ab n="8">And they
troubled the people, and the rulers of the citie, when they heard
these things.</ab>
<ab n="9">And when they
had taken securitie of Iason, and of the other, they let them
goe.</ab>
<ab n="10">¶ And the
brethren immediatly sent away Paul and Silas by night vnto Berea:
who comming thither, went into the Synagogue of the Iewes.</ab>
<ab n="11">These were more
noble then those in Thessalonica, in that they receiued the word
with all readinesse of minde, and searched the Scriptures dayly,
whether those things were so.</ab>
<ab n="12">Therefore many of
them beleeued: also of honourable women which were Greekes, and of
men not a few.</ab>
<ab n="13">But when the Iewes
of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of
Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred vp the
people.</ab>
<ab n="14">And then immediatly
the brethren sent away Paul, to goe as it were to the sea: but
Silas and Timotheus abode there still.</ab>
<ab n="15">And they that
conducted Paul, brought him vnto Athens, and receiuing a
commaundement vnto Silas and Timotheus, for to come to him with all
speed, they departed.</ab>
<ab n="16">¶ Now while
Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when
hee saw the city wholy giuen to idolatrie.<note> Or, full of idoles.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">Therefore disputed
he in the Synagogue with the Iewes, and with the deuout persons,
and in the market dayly with them that met with him.</ab>
<ab n="18">Then certaine
Philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoikes, encountred him:
and some said, What will this babbler say? Othersome, He seemeth to
be a setter foorth of strange gods: because hee preached vnto them
Iesus, and the resurrection.<note> Or, base fellow.</note></ab>

<fw>Paul preacheth, and disputeth.</fw>
<ab n="19">And they tooke him,
and brought him vnto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new
doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?<note> Or, Mars-hill: It was the highest court in Athens.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">For thou bringest
certaine strange things to our eares: we would know therefore what
these things meane.</ab>
<ab n="21">(For all the
Athenians and strangers which were there, spent their time in
nothing else, but either to tell or to heare some new
thing.)</ab>
<ab n="22">¶ Then Paul
stood in the mids of Mars-hill, and said, Yee men of Athens, I
perceiue that in all things yee are too superstitious.<note> Or, court of the Areopagites.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">For as I passed by,
and beheld your deuotions, I found an Altar with this inscription,
TO THE VNKNOWEN GOD. Whom therefore yee ignorantly worship, him
declare I vnto you.<note> Or, gods that you worship, 2. Thess. 2. 4.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">God that made the
world, and all things therein, seeing that hee is Lord of heauen
and earth, dwelleth not in Temples made with hands:<note> Cha. 7.48.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">Neither is
worshipped with mens hands as though he needed any thing, seeing
hee giueth to all, life and breath, and all things,<note> Psal.50.8.</note></ab>
<ab n="26">And hath made of
one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the
earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the
bounds of their habitation:</ab>
<ab n="27">That they should
seeke the Lord, if haply they might feele after him and finde him,
though he be not farre from euery one of vs.</ab>
<ab n="28">For in him we liue,
and mooue, and haue our being, as certaine also of your owne Poets
haue said, For we are also his offspring.</ab>
<ab n="29">Forasmuch then as
wee are the offspring of God, wee ought not to thinke that the
Godhead is like vnto golde, or siluer, or stone grauen by arte, and
mans deuice.<note> Esai 40.18</note></ab>
<ab n="30">And the times of
this ignorance God winked at, but now commandeth all men euery
where to repent:</ab>
<ab n="31">Because hee hath
appointed a day in the which he will iudge the world in
righteousnesse, by that man whom hee hath ordeined, whereof he hath
giuen assurance vnto all men, in that he hath raised him from the
dead.<note> Or, offered faith.</note></ab>

<fw>Paul preacheth, and disputeth.</fw>
<ab n="32">¶ And when
they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others
said, Wee will heare thee againe of this matter.</ab>
<ab n="33">So Paul departed
from among them.</ab>
<ab n="34">Howbeit, certaine
men claue vnto him, and beleeued: among the which was Dionysius the
Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with
them.</ab>
