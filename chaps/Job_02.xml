<head>CHAP. II.</head>
<head>1 Satan appearing againe before God,
obtaineth further leaue to tempt Iob. 7 He smiteth him with sore
boiles. 9 Iob reproueth his wife, moouing him to curse God. 11 His
three friends condole with him in silence.</head>

<ab n="1">Againe there was
a day when the sonnes of God came to present themselues before the
Lord, and Satan came also among them to present himselfe before the
Lord.</ab>
<ab n="2">And the Lord
said vnto Satan, From whence commest thou? And Satan answered the
Lord, and said, From going to &amp; fro in the earth, and from
walking vp and downe in it.<note> Chap.1. 7.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And the Lord
said vnto Satan, Hast thou considered my seruant Iob, that there is
none like him in the earth; a perfect and an vpright man, one that
feareth God, and escheweth euill? and still hee holdeth fast his
integritie, although thou moouedst mee against him, to destroy him
without cause.<note> Chap.1. ver.1. &amp;8. , Hebr. to swallow him vp.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">And Satan
answered the Lord, and said, Skinne for skinne, yea all that a man
hath, wil he giue for his life.</ab>

<fw>Iobs patience. His wife tempteth
him.</fw>
<ab n="5">But put foorth
thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse
thee to thy face.</ab>
<ab n="6">And the Lord
said vnto Satan, Behold, hee is in thine hand, but saue his
life.<note> Or, onely.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">¶ So went
Satan foorth from the presence of the Lord, and smote Iob with sore
biles, from the sole of his foote vnto his crowne.</ab>
<ab n="8">And hee tooke
him a potsheard to scrape himselfe withall; and hee sate downe
among the ashes.</ab>
<ab n="9">¶ Then
saide his wife vnto him, Doest thou still reteine thine integritie?
Curse God, and die.</ab>
<ab n="10">But he said
vnto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh; what?
shall wee receiue good at the hand of God, and shall wee not
receiue euill? In all this did not Iob sinne with his
lippes.</ab>
<ab n="11">¶ Now when
Iobs three friends heard of all this euill, that was come vpon him,
they came euery one from his owne place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and
Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; for they had made an
appointment together to come to mourne with him, and to comfort
him.</ab>
<ab n="12">And when they
lift vp their eyes afarre off, and knew him not, they lifted vp
their voice, and wept; and they rent euery one his mantle, and
sprinckled dust vpon their heades toward heauen.</ab>
<ab n="13">So they sate
downe with him vpon the ground seuen dayes, and seuen nights, and
none spake a word vnto him; for they saw that his griefe was very
great.</ab>
