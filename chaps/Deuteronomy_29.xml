<head>CHAP.
XXIX.</head>
<head>1 Moses exhorteth them to obedience,
by the memorie of the workes they haue seene. 10 All are presented
before the Lord to enter into his Couenant. 18 The great wrath on
him that flattereth himselfe in his wickednes. 29 Secret things
belong vnto God.</head>

<ab n="1">These are the
woordes of the Couenant which the Lord commanded Moses to make with
the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the Couenant
which he made with them in Horeb.</ab>
<ab n="2">¶ And
Moses called vnto all Israel, and said vnto them, Yee haue seene
all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt vnto
Pharaoh, and vnto all his seruants, and vnto all his
land;<note> Exod. 19. 4.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">The great
temptations which thine eyes haue seene, the signes and those great
miracles:</ab>
<ab n="4">Yet the Lord
hath not giuen you an heart to perceiue, and eyes to see, and eares
to heare, vnto this day.</ab>
<ab n="5">And I haue
led you fourtie yeres in the wildernes: your clothes are not waxen
old vpon you, and thy shooe is not waxen old vpon thy foot.</ab>
<ab n="6">Ye haue not
eaten bread, neither haue you drunke wine, or strong drink: that
yee might knowe that I am the Lord your God.</ab>
<ab n="7">And when yee
came vnto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the King of
Bashan, came out against vs vnto battell, and wee smote
them.</ab>
<ab n="8">And wee tooke
their lande, and gaue it for an inheritance vnto the Reubenites,
and to the Gadites, and to the halfe tribe of Manasseh.</ab>

<fw>Gods couenant.</fw>
<ab n="9">Keepe
therefore the wordes of this Couenant and doe them, that yee may
prosper in all that ye doe.<note> Chap. 4.6. 1.king.2.2. iosh.1.7.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">¶ Ye
stand this day all of you before the Lord your God: your captaines
of your tribes, your Elders, and your officers, with all the men of
Israel,</ab>
<ab n="11">Your litle
ones, your wiues, and thy stranger that is in thy campe, from the
hewer of thy wood, vnto the drawer of thy water:</ab>
<ab n="12">That thou
shouldest enter into Couenant with the Lord thy God, and into his
othe which the Lord thy God maketh with thee this day:<note> Heb. passe.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">That he may
establish thee to day for a people vnto himselfe, and that hee may
be vnto thee a God, as he hath said vnto thee, and as he hath
sworne vnto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to
Iacob.</ab>
<ab n="14">Neither with
you onely doe I make this couenant and this othe:</ab>
<ab n="15">But with him
that standeth here with vs this day before the Lord our God, and
also with him that is not here with vs this day:</ab>
<ab n="16">(For ye know
how we haue dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we came thorow the
nations which ye passed by.</ab>
<ab n="17">And ye haue
seene their abominations, and their idoles, wood, and stone,
siluer, and gold, which were among them.)<note> Heb. donguie gods.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Lest there
should be among you man or woman, or familie, or tribe, whose heart
turneth away this day frō the Lord our God, to goe and serue
the gods of these nations: lest there should bee among you a root
that beareth gall and wormewood,<note> Or, a poisonfull herbe Heb. Rosh.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">And it come
to passe when he heareth the wordes of this curse, that hee blesse
himselfe in his heart, saying, I shall haue peace, though I walke
in the imagination of mine heart, to adde drunkennesse to
thirst:<note> Or, stubbornnesse. , Heb. the drunken to the thirstie.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">The Lord wil
not spare him, but then the anger of the Lord, and his ielousie
shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written
in this booke shall lie vpon him, and the Lord shall blot out his
name from vnder heauen.</ab>
<ab n="21">And the Lord
shall separate him vnto euill, out of all the tribes of Israel,
according to all the curses of the Couenant, that are written in
this booke of the Law:<note> Hebr. is written.</note></ab>

<fw>Mercie to the repentant.</fw>
<ab n="22">So that the
generation to come of your children, that shall rise vp after you,
and the stranger that shall come from a farre land, shall say, when
they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the
Lord hath layd vpon it;<note> Hebr. wherewith the LORD hath made it sicke.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">And that the
whole land thereof is brimstone and salt, and burning, that it is
not sowen, nor beareth, nor any grasse groweth therein, like the
ouerthrow of Sodome, and Gomorah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the Lord
ouerthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:<note> Gen. 19. 24, 25.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">Euen al
nations shal say, Wherefore hath the Lord done thus vnto this land?
what meaneth the heat of this great anger?<note> 1.King.9. 8. iere.22.8.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">Then men
shall say, Because they haue forsaken the Couenant of the Lord God
of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them
foorth out of the land of Egypt.</ab>
<ab n="26">For they
went and serued other gods, &amp; worshipped them, gods whom they
knew not, and whom he had not giuen vnto them.<note> Hebr. diuided: Or, who had not giuen to them any portion.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">And the
anger of the Lord was kindled against this land, to bring vpon it
all the curses, that are written in this booke.</ab>
<ab n="28">And the Lord
rooted them out of their land, in anger and in wrath, and in great
indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this
day.</ab>
<ab n="29">The secret
things belong vnto the Lord our God: but those things which are
reuealed belong vnto vs, and to our children for euer, that wee may
doe all the words of this Law.</ab>
