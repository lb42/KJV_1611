awake; nor bee raised out of their sleepe.</ab>

wouldest hide mee in the graue, that thou wouldest keepe me secret,
vntill thy wrath bee past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set
time, and remember me.</ab>

weare the stones, thou washest away the things which growe out of
the dust of the earth, and thou destroyest the hope of
man.<note> Heb. ouerflowest.</note></ab>

preuailest for euer against him, and hee passeth: thou changest his
countenance, and sendest him away.</ab>

come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought lowe,
but he perceiueth it not of them.</ab>

vpon him shall haue paine, and his soule within him shall
mourne.</ab>
