<head>CHAP.
XVI.</head>
<head>1 The Prophet, vnder the types of
abstaining from marriage, from houses of mourning and feasting,
foresheweth the vtter ruine of the Iewes, 10 because they were
worse then their fathers. 14 Their returne from captiuitie, shall
be stranger then their deliuerance out of Egypt. 16 God will doubly
recompense their idolatrie.</head>


<fw>The Iewes ruine.</fw>
<ab n="1">The word of the
Lord came also vnto me, saying;</ab>
<ab n="2">Thou shalt not
take thee a wife, neither shalt thou haue sonnes nor daughters in
this place.</ab>
<ab n="3">For thus sayth
the Lord concerning the sonnes and concerning the daughters that
are borne in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare
them, and concerning their fathers that begate them in this
land:</ab>
<ab n="4">They shal die of
grieuous deaths, they shall not bee lamented, neither shall they be
buried: but they shall be as doung vpon the face of the earth, and
they shalbe consumed by the sword, and by famine, and their
carkeises shall be meate for the foules of heauen, and for the
beasts of the earth.<note> Cha.15.2. , Chap.25. 33. , Chap.7.33 and 34.20. psal. 39.2.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">For thus sayth
the Lord, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither goe to
lament nor bemoane them: for I haue taken away my peace from this
people, sayth the Lord, euen louing kindnesse and
mercies.<note> Or, mourning feast.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">Both the great
and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried,
neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselues, nor make
themselues balde for them.</ab>
<ab n="7">Neither shall
men teare themselues for them in mourning to comfort them for the
dead, neither shall men giue them the cuppe of consolation to
drinke for their father, or for their mother.<note> Leuit.19. 28. deut. 14.1. , Or, breake bread for them, as Ezek. 24.17.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Thou shalt not
also goe into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to
drinke.</ab>
<ab n="9">For thus sayth
the Lord of hostes, the God of Israel: Behold, I will cause to
cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your dayes, the voice
of mirth, and the voice of gladnesse, the voice of the bridegroome,
and the voice of the bride.<note> Isai. 24.7, 8. chap.7. 34. and 25. 10. ezek. 26.10.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">¶ And it
shal come to passe when thou shalt shewe this people all these
wordes, and they shall say vnto thee; Wherefore hath the Lord
pronounced all this great euill against vs? or what is our
iniquitie? or what is our sinne, that we haue committed against the
Lord our God?<note> Cha. 5.19. and 13.22.</note></ab>

<fw>Fishers, and hunters.</fw>
<ab n="11">Then shalt thou
say vnto them; Because your fathers haue forsaken me, saith the
Lord, and haue walked after other Gods, and haue serued them, and
haue worshipped them, and haue forsaken mee, and haue not kept my
law:</ab>
<ab n="12">And yee haue
done worse then your fathers, (for behold, yee walke euerie one
after the imagination of his euill heart, that they may not hearken
vnto me.)<note> Chap.7. 26. , Or, stubburnnesse.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Therefore will
I cast you out of this land into a land that yee knowe not, neither
yee, nor your fathers, and there shall yee serue other Gods day and
night, where I will not shewe you fauour.<note> Deut.4. 27. and 28. 64, 65.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">¶
Therefore behold, the dayes come, saith the Lord, that it shall no
more be said; The Lord liueth that brought vp the children of
Israel out of the land of Egypt;<note> Chap. 23. 7, 8.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">But, The Lord
liueth, that brought vp the children of Israel from the land of the
North, and from all the lands whither hee had driuen them: and I
will bring them againe into their land, that I gaue vnto their
fathers.</ab>
<ab n="16">¶ Behold,
I will send for many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shal fish
them, and after will I send for manie hunters, and they shall hunt
them from euery mountaine, and from euery hill, and out of the
holes of the rockes.</ab>
<ab n="17">For mine eyes
are vpon all their waies: they are not hid from my face, neither is
their iniquitie hid from mine eies.<note> Iob.34.21 prou. 5. 21. chap. 32. 19.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">And first I
will recompense their iniquitie, and their sinne double, because
they haue defiled my land, they haue filled mine inheritance with
the carkeises of their detestable and abominable things.</ab>
<ab n="19">O Lord, my
strength and my fortresse, and my refuge in the day of affliction;
the Gentiles shall come vnto thee from the ends of the earth, and
shall say; Surely our fathers haue inherited lyes, vanitie, and
things wherein there is no profit.</ab>
<ab n="20">Shall a man
make Gods vnto himselfe, and they are no Gods?<note> Chap. 2. 11.</note></ab>

<fw>The heart wicked.</fw>
<ab n="21">Therefore
behold, I will this once cause them to know: I will cause them to
knowe mine hand and my might, and they shall know that my name is
the Lord.</ab>
