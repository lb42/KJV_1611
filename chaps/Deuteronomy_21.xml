<ab n="1">If one bee
found slaine in the lande, which the Lord thy God giueth thee to
possesse it, lying in the fielde, and it bee not knowen who hath
slaine him:</ab>
<ab n="2">Then thy
Elders and thy Iudges shall come forth, and they shall measure vnto
the cities which are round about him that is slaine.</ab>

<fw>Of murder that is not knowen.</fw>
<ab n="3">And it shall
be that the citie which is next vnto the slaine man, euen the
Elders of that citie shall take an heifer which hath not bene
wrought with, and which hath not drawen in the yoke.</ab>
<ab n="4">And the
Elders of that citie shall bring downe the heifer vnto a rough
valley, which is neither eared nor sowen, and shall strike off the
heifers necke there in the valley.</ab>
<ab n="5">And the
Priests the sonnes of Leui shall come neere (for them the Lord thy
God hath chosen to minister vnto him, and to blesse in the Name of
the Lord: ) and by their worde shall euery controuersie and euery
stroke bee tried.<note> Heb. mouth</note></ab>
<ab n="6">And all the
Elders of that city that are next vnto the slaine man, shal wash
their hands ouer the heifer that is beheaded in the valley.</ab>
<ab n="7">And they
shall answere, and say, Our hands haue not shedde this blood,
neither haue our eyes seene it.</ab>
<ab n="8">Be merciful,
O Lord, vnto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay
not innocent blood vnto thy people of Israels charge, and the blood
shall be forgiuen them.<note> Heb. in the middest.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">So shalt thou
put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when thou
shalt do that which is right in the sight of the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="10">¶ When
thou goest forth to warre against thine enemies, and the Lord thy
God hath deliuered them into thine hands, &amp; thou hast taken
them captiue,</ab>
<ab n="11">And seest
among the captiues a beautifull woman, and hast a desire vnto her,
that thou wouldest haue her to thy wife:</ab>
<ab n="12">Then thou
shalt bring her home to thine house, and shee shall shaue her head,
and pare her nailes.<note> Or, suffer to grow. Heb. make or dresse.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">And shee
shall put the raiment of her captiuitie from off her, and shall
remaine in thine house, and bewaile her father and her mother a
full moneth: and after that, thou shalt go in vnto her and be her
husband, and she shall be thy wife.</ab>
<ab n="14">And it shall
be if thou haue no delight in her, then thou shalt let her goe
whither she will, but thou shalt not sell her at al for money, thou
shalt not make merchandize of her, because thou hast humbled
her.</ab>

<fw>The first borne.</fw>
<ab n="15">¶ If a
man haue two wiues, one beloued and another hated, and they haue
borne him children, both the beloned, and the hated: and if the
first borne sonne be hers that was hated:</ab>
<ab n="16">Then it
shall be, when he maketh his sonnes to inherite that which hee
hath, that he may not make the sonne of the beloued, first borne,
before the sonne of the hated, which is indeed the first
borne:</ab>
<ab n="17">But hee
shall acknowledge the sonne of the hated for the first borne, by
giuing him a double portion of all that hee hath: for hee is the
beginning of his strength; the right of the first borne is
his.<note> Hebr. that is found with him.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">¶ If a
man haue a stubborne and rebellious sonne, which will not obey the
voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that when they
haue chastened him, wil not hearken vnto them:</ab>
<ab n="19">Then shall
his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out vnto
the Elders of his citie, and vnto the gate of his place:</ab>
<ab n="20">And they
shall say vnto the Elders of his citie, This our sonne is
stubborne, and rebellious, hee will not obey our voice: he is a
glutton, &amp; a drunkard.</ab>
<ab n="21">And all the
men of his city shall stone him with stones, that hee die: so shalt
thou put euill away from among you, and all Israel shall heare,
&amp; feare.</ab>
<ab n="22">¶ And
if a man haue committed a sinne worthy of death, and he be to be
put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:</ab>
<ab n="23">His body
shall not remaine all night vpon the tree, but thou shalt in any
wise bury him that day: for he that is hanged, is accursed of God:
that thy land be not defiled, which the Lord thy God giueth thee
for an inheritance.<note> Gal.3.13. , Hebr. the curse of God.</note></ab>
