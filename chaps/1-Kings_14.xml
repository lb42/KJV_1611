<ab n="1">At that time
Abiiah the sonne of Ieroboam fell sicke.</ab>

<fw>Ieroboams sonnes death and
buriall.</fw>
<ab n="2">And Ieroboam said
to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thy selfe, that thou
be not knowen to be the wife of Ieroboam: and get thee to Shiloh:
Behold, there is Ahiiah the Prophet, which told mee that I should
be king ouer this people.<note> Chap.11. 31.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And take with
thee ten loaues, and cracknels, and a cruse of honie, and goe to
him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the
childe.<note> Heb. in thine hand. , Or, cakes. , Or, bottle.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">And Ieroboams
wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house
of Ahiiah: but Ahiiah could not see, for his eyes were set by
reason of his age.<note> Heb. stood for hoarines.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">¶ And the
Lord said vnto Ahiiah, Behold, the wife of Ieroboam commeth to aske
a thing of thee for her sonne, for hee is sicke: thus and thus
shalt thou say vnto her: for it shall be when shee commeth in, that
shee shall faine her selfe to be another woman.</ab>
<ab n="6">And it was so,
when Ahiiah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the
doore, that hee said, Come in, thou wife of Ieroboam, why fainest
thou thy selfe to be another? for I am sent to thee with heauie
tidings.<note> Heb. hard.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">Goe, tell
Ieroboam, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted
thee from among the people, and made thee prince ouer my people
Israel,</ab>
<ab n="8">And rent the
kingdome away from the house of Dauid, and gaue it thee: and yet
thou hast not beene as my seruant Dauid, who kept my Commandements,
and who followed mee with all his heart, to doe that onely which
was right in mine eyes,</ab>
<ab n="9">But hast done
euill aboue all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made
thee other gods, and molten images, to prouoke me to anger, and
hast cast me behinde thy backe:</ab>
<ab n="10">Therefore
behold, I will bring euill vpon the house of Ieroboam, and will cut
off from Ieroboam, him that pisseth against the wall, and him that
is shut vp and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of
the house of Ieroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all
gone.<note> 1.King. 15.29. , Chap.21. 21. 2.king. 9.8.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">Him that dieth
of Ieroboam in the citie, shall the dogs eate: and him that dieth
in the field, shall the foules of the aire eate: for the Lord hath
spoken it.</ab>
<ab n="12">Arise thou
therefore, get thee to thine owne house: and when thy feete enter
into the citie, the child shall die.</ab>

<fw>Ieroboams sonnes death and
buriall.</fw>
<ab n="13">And all Israel
shall mourne for him, and bury him: for he onely of Ieroboam shal
come to the graue, because in him there is found some good thing
toward the Lord God of Israel, in the house of Ieroboam.</ab>
<ab n="14">Moreouer, the
Lord shall raise him vp a king ouer Israel, who shal cut off the
house of Ieroboam that day: but what? euen now.</ab>
<ab n="15">For the Lord
shall smite Israel, as a reede is shaken in the water, and hee
shall root vp Israel out of this good land, which hee gaue to their
fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the Riuer, because they haue
made their groues, prouoking the Lord to anger.</ab>
<ab n="16">And hee shall
giue Israel vp, because of the sinnes of Ieroboam, who did sinne,
&amp; who made Israel to sinne.</ab>
<ab n="17">¶ And
Ieroboams wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when
shee came to the threshold of the doore, the child died.</ab>
<ab n="18">And they buried
him, and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the
Lord, which hee spake by the hand of his seruant Ahiiah the
Prophet.</ab>
<ab n="19">And the rest of
the actes of Ieroboam, how hee warred, and how hee reigned, behold,
they are written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of
Israel.</ab>
<ab n="20">And the dayes
which Ieroboam reigned, were two and twentie yeeres: and he slept
with his fathers, and Nadab his sonne reigned in his
stead.<note> Heb. lay downe.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">¶ And
Rehoboam the sonne of Solomon reigned in Iudah: Rehoboam was
fourtie and one yeeres olde when he began to reigne, and hee
reigned seuenteene yeeres in Ierusalem, the citie which the Lord
did chuse out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his Name there:
and his mothers name was Naamah an Ammonitesse.<note> 2.Chron. 12.13.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">And Iudah did
euill in the sight of the Lord, and they prouoked him to iealousie
with their sinnes which they had committed, aboue all that their
fathers had done.</ab>
<ab n="23">For they also
built them high places, and images, and groues on euery high hill,
and vnder euery greene tree.<note> Or, standing images, or statues.</note></ab>

<fw>Ieroboam dieth.</fw>
<ab n="24">And there were
also Sodomites in the land, and they did according to all the
abominations of the nations which the Lord cast out before the
children of Israel.</ab>
<ab n="25">¶ And it
came to passe in the fift yeere of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king
of Egypt came vp against Ierusalem:</ab>
<ab n="26">And he tooke
away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of
the kings house, hee euen tooke away all: and he tooke away all the
shields of gold which Solomon had made.<note> Chap. 10. 16.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">And king
Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed them
vnto the hands of the chiefe of the guard, which kept the doore of
the kings house.<note> Heb. runners.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">And it was so,
when the king went into the house of the Lord, that the guard bare
them, and brought them backe into the guard-chamber.</ab>
<ab n="29">¶ Nowe the
rest of the actes of Rehoboam, and all that hee did, are they not
written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of
Iudah?</ab>
<ab n="30">And there was
warre betweene Rehoboam and Ieroboam all their dayes.</ab>
<ab n="31">And Rehoboam
slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city
of Dauid: and his mothers name was Naamah an Ammonitesse. And
Abijam his sonne reigned in his stead.</ab>
