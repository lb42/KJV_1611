<head>CHAP.
XXVI.</head>
<head>1 Saul by the discouery of the
Ziphites, commeth to Hachilah against Dauid. 4 Dauid comming into
the trench, stayeth Abishai from killing Saul, but taketh his
speare and cruse. 13 Dauid reprooueth Abner, 18 and exhorteth Saul.
21 Saul acknowledgeth his sinne.</head>

<ab n="1">And the Ziphites
came vnto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doeth not Dauid hide himselfe in
the hill of Hachilah, which is before Ieshimon?<note> Chap.23. 19.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">Then Saul arose,
and went downe to the wildernesse of Ziph, hauing three thousand
chosen men of Israel with him, to seeke Dauid in the wildernesse of
Ziph.</ab>
<ab n="3">And Saul pitched
in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Ieshimon by the way: but
Dauid abode in the wildernesse, and he saw that Saul came after him
into the wildernesse.</ab>
<ab n="4">Dauid therefore
sent out spies, and vnderstood that Saul was come in very
deed.</ab>
<ab n="5">¶ And Dauid
arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and Dauid
beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the sonne of Ner the
captaine of his hoste: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people
pitched round about him.<note> Chap.14. 50. and 17. 55. , Or, midst of his carriages.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">Then answered
Dauid, and sayd to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the sonne
of Zeruiah brother to Ioab, saying, Who will goe downe with me to
Saul to the campe? And Abishai sayd, I will goe downe with
thee.</ab>

<fw>Dauid declareth his innocencie.</fw>
<ab n="7">So Dauid and
Abishai came to the people by night, and behold, Saul lay sleeping
within the trench, and his speare stucke in the ground at his
bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.</ab>
<ab n="8">Then said
Abishai to Dauid, God hath deliuered thine enemie into thine hand
this day: now therefore let mee smite him, I pray thee, with the
speare, euen to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the
second time.<note> Heb. shut vp.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And Dauid sayd
to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand
against the Lords Anointed, and be guiltlesse?</ab>
<ab n="10">Dauid said
furthermore, As the Lord liueth, the Lord shal smite him, or his
day shall come to die, or hee shall descend into battell, and
perish.</ab>
<ab n="11">The Lord forbid
that I should stretch foorth mine hand against the Lords Anointed:
but I pray thee, take thou now the speare that is at his bolster,
and the cruse of water, and let vs goe.</ab>
<ab n="12">So Dauid tooke
the speare and the cruse of water from Sauls bolster, and they gate
them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they
were all asleepe, because a deepe sleepe from the Lord was fallen
vpon them.</ab>
<ab n="13">¶ Then
Dauid went ouer to the other side, and stood on the toppe of an
hill afarre off (a great space being betweene them:)</ab>
<ab n="14">And Dauid cryed
to the people, and to Abner the sonne of Ner, saying, Answerest
thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered, and sayd, Who art thou that
cryest to the King?</ab>
<ab n="15">And Dauid said
to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in
Israel? Wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for
there came one of the people in, to destroy the king thy
lord.</ab>
<ab n="16">This thing is
not good that thou hast done: as the Lord liueth, ye are worthy to
die, because yee haue not kept your master the Lords Anointed: and
now see where the Kings speare is, and the cruse of water that was
at his bolster.<note> Heb. the sonnes of death.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">And Saul knew
Dauids voyce, and said, Is this thy voice, my sonne Dauid? And
Dauid saide, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</ab>
<ab n="18">And he said,
Wherefore doeth my lord thus pursue after his seruant? for what
haue I done? or what euill is in mine hand?</ab>

<fw>Dauid declareth his innocencie.</fw>
<ab n="19">Now therefore,
I pray thee, let my lord the king heare the words of his seruant:
If the Lord haue stirred thee vp against mee, let him accept an
offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before
the Lord: for they haue driuen me out this day from abiding in the
inheritance of the Lord, saying, Goe serue other gods.<note> Heb. smell. , Heb. cleauing.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">Now therefore,
let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the Lord: for
the king of Israel is come out to seeke a flea, as when one doeth
hunt a partridge in the mountaines.</ab>
<ab n="21">¶ Then
said Saul, I haue sinned: Returne, my sonne Dauid, for I will no
more doe thee harme, because my soule was precious in thine eyes
this day: behold, I haue played the foole, and haue erred
exceedingly.</ab>
<ab n="22">And Dauid
answered, and sayd, Behold the kings speare, and let one of the
yong men come ouer and fetch it.</ab>
<ab n="23">The Lord render
to euery man his righteousnesse, and his faithfulnesse: for the
Lord deliuered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch
foorth mine hand against the Lords Anointed.</ab>
<ab n="24">And behold, as
thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes: so let my life bee
much set by in the eyes of the Lord, and let him deliuer me out of
all tribulation.</ab>
<ab n="25">Then Saul said
to Dauid, Blessed be thou, my sonne Dauid: thou shalt both doe
great things, and also shalt still preuaile. So Dauid went on his
way, and Saul returned to his place.</ab>
