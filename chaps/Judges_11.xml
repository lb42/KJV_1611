<head>CHAP. XI.</head>
<head>1 The Couenant betweene Iephthah and
the Gileadites, that hee should be their head. 12 The treaty of
peace betweene him and the Ammonites is in vaine. 29 Iephthahs vow.
32 His conquest of the Ammonites. 34 He performeth his vow on his
daughter.</head>

<ab n="1">Now Iephthah the
Gileadite was a mightie man of valour, and he was the sonne of an
harlot: and Gilead begate Iephthah.<note> Hebr.11. 32. called Iephte. , Hebr. woman, an harlot.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And Gileads wife
bare him sonnes, and his wiues sonnes grew vp, and they thrust out
Iephthah, and said vnto him, Thou shalt not inherite in our fathers
house, for thou art the son of a strange woman.</ab>
<ab n="3">Then Iephthah fled
from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were
gathered vaine men to Iephthah, and went out with him.<note> Hebr. from the face.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">¶ And it came
to passe, in processe of time, that the children of Ammon made
warre against Israel.<note> Hebr. after dayes.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">And it was so,
that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the Elders
of Gilead went to fetch Iephthah out of the land of Tob,</ab>
<ab n="6">And they said vnto
Iephthah, Come and bee our Captaine, that wee may fight with the
children of Ammon.</ab>
<ab n="7">And Iephthah said
vnto the Elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expell me out of
my fathers house? And why are ye come vnto mee now when ye are in
distresse?</ab>
<ab n="8">And the Elders of
Gilead said vnto Iephthah, Therefore we turne againe to thee now,
that thou mayest go with vs, and fight against the children of
Ammon, and bee our head ouer all the inhabitants of Gilead.</ab>
<ab n="9">And Iephthah said
vnto the Elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home againe to fight
against the children of Ammon, and the Lord deliuer them before me;
shall I be your Head?</ab>
<ab n="10">And the Elders of
Gilead said vnto Iephthah, The Lord be witnes betweene vs, if we
doe not so according to thy words.<note> Hebr. be the hearer betweene vs.</note></ab>

<fw>Iephthah captaine.</fw>
<ab n="11">Then Iephthah
went with the Elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and
captaine ouer them: and Iephthah vttered all his words before the
Lord in Mizpeh.</ab>
<ab n="12">¶ And
Iephthah sent messengers vnto the king of the children of Ammon,
saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against
mee to fight in my land?</ab>
<ab n="13">And the king of
the children of Ammon answered vnto the messengers of Iephthah;
Because Israel tooke away my land when they came vp out of Egypt,
from Arnon euen vnto Iabbok, and vnto Iordan: now therfore restore
those lands againe peaceably.<note> Num.21. 13.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And Iephthah sent
messengers againe vnto the king of the children of Ammon:</ab>
<ab n="15">And said vnto
him, Thus saith Iephthah; Israel tooke not away the land of Moab,
nor the land of the children of Ammon:<note> Deut.2.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">But when Israel
came vp from Egypt, and walked through the wildernesse, vnto the
red sea, and came to Kadesh;</ab>
<ab n="17">Then Israel sent
messengers vnto the king of Edom saying, Let me, I pray thee, passe
through thy land. But the king of Edom would not hearken thereto:
And in like maner they sent vnto the king of Moab: but hee would
not consent: &amp; Israel abode in Kadesh.<note> Num.20. 14.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Then they went
along through the wildernes, and compassed the land of Edom, and
the land of Moab, and came by the Eastside of the land of Moab, and
pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border
of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.<note> Num.22. 13.and 22. 24.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">And Israel sent
messengers vnto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon,
and Israel said vnto him, Let vs passe, we pray thee, thorow thy
land, vnto my place.<note> Deut.2. 26.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">But Sihon trusted
not Israel, to passe through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his
people together, and pitched in Iahaz, and fought against
Israel.</ab>
<ab n="21">And the Lord God
of Israel deliuered Sihon and all his people into the hand of
Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of
the Amorites, the inhabitants of that countrey.</ab>

<fw>His rash vow.</fw>
<ab n="22">And they
possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon euen vnto
Iabbok, and from the wildernesse euen vnto Iordan.<note> Deut.2. 36.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">So nowe the Lord
God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people
Israel, and shouldest thou possesse it?</ab>
<ab n="24">Wilt not thou
possesse that which Chemosh thy god giueth thee to possesse? so
whomsoeuer the Lord our God shal driue out from before vs, them
will we possesse.</ab>
<ab n="25">And now, art thou
any thing better then Balak the sonne of Zippor king of Moab? Did
hee euer striue against Israel, or did hee euer fight against
them,<note> Num. 22. 2. deut. 23. 4. iosh. 24.9</note></ab>
<ab n="26">While Israel
dwelt in Heshbon, and her townes, and in Aroer, and her townes, and
in all the cities that bee along by the coasts of Arnon, three
hundred yeeres? Why therefore did yee not recouer them within that
time?</ab>
<ab n="27">Wherefore, I haue
not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to warre against
mee: the Lord the Iudge, bee Iudge this day betweene the children
of Israel, and the children of Ammon.</ab>
<ab n="28">Howbeit, the king
of the children of Ammon hearkened not vnto the words of Iephthah
which hee sent him.</ab>
<ab n="29">¶ Then the
Spirit of the Lord came vpon Iephthah, and he passed ouer Gilead
and Manasseh, and passed ouer Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of
Gilead hee passed ouer vnto the children of Ammon.</ab>
<ab n="30">And Iephthah
vowed a vowe vnto the Lord, and said, If thou shalt without faile
deliuer the children of Ammon into mine hands,</ab>
<ab n="31">Then it shall be,
that whatsoeuer commeth forth of the doores of my house to meete
me, when I returne in peace from the children of Ammon, shall
surely be the Lords, and I will offer it vp for a burnt
offering.<note> Hebr. that which commeth forth shall come forth. , Or, I will offer it, &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="32">¶ So
Iephthah passed ouer vnto the children of Ammon to fight against
them, and the Lord deliuered them into his hands.</ab>

<fw>Iephthahs daughter:</fw>
<ab n="33">And he smote them
from Aroer, euen till thou come to Minnith, euen twentie cities,
and vnto the plaine of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter:
thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of
Israel.<note> Or, Abel.</note></ab>
<ab n="34">¶ And
Iephthah came to Mizpeh vnto his house, and beholde, his daughter
came out to meete him with timbrels and with dances, and she was
his onely childe: beside her he had neither sonne nor
daughter.<note> Or, he had not of his owne either sonne or daughter. Heb. of himselfe.</note></ab>
<ab n="35">And it came to
passe when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my
daughter, thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them
that trouble me: for I haue opened my mouth vnto the Lord, and I
cannot goe backe.</ab>
<ab n="36">And she said vnto
him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth vnto the Lord, doe to
me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth;
forasmuch as the Lord hath taken vengeance for thee of thine
enemies, euen of the children of Ammon.</ab>
<ab n="37">And she said vnto
her father, Let this thing be done for me: Let me alone two
moneths, that I may goe vp and downe vpon the mountaines, and
bewaile my virginitie, I, and my fellowes.<note> Heb. Goe, and goe downe.</note></ab>
<ab n="38">And he said, Goe.
And he sent her away for two moneths, and shee went with her
companions, and bewailed her virginitie vpon the
mountaines.</ab>
<ab n="39">And it came to
passe at the ende of two moneths that shee returned vnto her
father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed:
and she knew no man: &amp; it was a custome in Israel,<note> Or, ordinance.</note></ab>
<ab n="40">That the
daughters of Israel went yeerely to lament the daughter of Iephthah
the Gileadite foure dayes in a yeere.<note> Heb. from yeere to yere. , Or, to talke with.</note></ab>
