<fw>The euill tongue.</fw>
<ab n="1">[To the chiefe
Musician, Maschil, A Psalme of Dauid: When Doeg the Edomite came
and told Saul, and said vnto him, Dauid is come to the house of
Ahimelech.] Why boastest thou thy selfe in mischiefe, O mightie
man? the goodnesse of God indureth continually.</ab>
<ab n="2">Thy tongue
deuiseth mischiefes: like a sharpe rasor, working
deceitfully.</ab>
<ab n="3">Thou louest euill
more then good; and lying rather then to speake righteousnesse.
Selah.</ab>
<ab n="4">Thou louest all
deuouring words, O thou deceitfull tongue.<note> Or, and the deceitfull tongue.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">God shall likewise
destroy thee for euer, hee shall take thee away and plucke thee out
of thy dwelling place, and roote thee out of the land of the
liuing. Selah.<note> Heb. beate thee downe.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">The righteous also
shall see, and feare, and shall laugh at him.</ab>
<ab n="7">Loe, this is the
man that made not God his strength: but trusted in the abundance of
his riches, and strengthened himselfe in his
wickednesse.<note> Or, substance.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">But I am like a
greene oliue tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God
for euer and euer.</ab>
<ab n="9">I will prayse thee
for euer, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name,
for it is good before thy Saints.</ab>
