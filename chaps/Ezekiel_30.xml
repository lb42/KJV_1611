<head>CHAP.
XXX.</head>
<head>1 The desolation of Egypt, and her
helpers. 20 The arme of Babylon shalbe strengthened to breake the
arme of Egypt.</head>

<ab n="1">The word of the
Lord came againe vnto me, saying,</ab>
<ab n="2">Sonne of man,
prophecie and say, Thus saith the Lord God, Howle ye, woe worth the
day.</ab>
<ab n="3">For the day is
neere, euen the day of the Lord is neere, a cloudie day; it shalbe
the time of the heathen.</ab>
<ab n="4">And the sword
shall come vpon Egypt, and great paine shalbe in Ethiopia, when the
slaine shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude,
and her foundations shalbe broken downe.<note> Or, feare.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">Ethiopia, and
Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Chub, and the men
of the land that is in league, shal fal with them by the
sword.<note> Heb. Phut. , Hebr. children.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">Thus saith the
Lord, They also that vphold Egypt shall fall, and the pride of her
power shall come downe: from the towre of Syene shall they fall in
it by the sword, saith the Lord God.</ab>
<ab n="7">And they shall
bee desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and
her cities shalbe in the midst of the cities that are
wasted.</ab>
<ab n="8">And they shall
know that I am the Lord, when I haue set a fire in Egypt, and when
all her helpers shall be destroied.<note> Hebr. broken.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">In that day shall
messengers goe foorth from me in shippes, to make the carelesse
Ethiopians afraid, and great paine shall come vpon them, as in the
day of Egypt: for loe, it commeth.</ab>
<ab n="10">Thus saith the
Lord God, I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the
hand of Nebuchad-rezzar, king of Babylon.</ab>
<ab n="11">He and his
people with him, the terrible of the nations shall be brought to
destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords against Egypt,
and fill the land with the slaine.</ab>

<fw>The desolation of Egypt.</fw>
<ab n="12">And I will make
the riuers drie, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked, and
I wil make the land wast, and all that is therein, by the hand of
strangers: I the Lord haue spoken it.<note> Hebr. drought. , Hebr. the fulnesse thereof.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Thus saith the
Lord God, I will also destroy the idoles, and I will cause their
images to cease out of Noph: and there shalbe no more a Prince of
the land of Egypt, and I will put a feare in the land of
Egypt.<note> Zach.13. 2.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And I wil make
Pathros desolate, and wil set fire in Zoan, and will execute
iudgements in No.<note> Or, Tanis.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">And I wil powre
my furie vpon Sin, the strength of Egypt, and I wil cut off the
multitude of No.<note> Or, Pelusium.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">And I will set
fire in Egypt, Sin shall haue great paine, and No shall be rent
asunder, and Noph shall haue distresses daily.</ab>
<ab n="17">The yong men of
Auen and of Phibeseth, shall fall by the sword: and these cities
shall goe into captiuitie.<note> Or, Heliopolis. , Or, Pubastum.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">At Tehaphnehes
also the day shalbe darkened when I shall breake there the yokes of
Egypt: &amp; the pompe of her strength shall cease in her: as for
her, a cloud shall couer her, and her daughters shall goe into
captiuitie.<note> Or, restrained.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">Thus will I
execute iudgements in Egypt, and they shall know that I am the
Lord.</ab>
<ab n="20">Â¶ And it
came to passe in the eleuenth yeere, in the first moneth, in the
seuenth day of the moneth, that the word of the Lord came vnto me,
saying,</ab>
<ab n="21">Sonne of man, I
haue broken the arme of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and loe, it shall
not be bound vp to be healed, to put a rouler to binde it, to make
it strong to hold the sword.</ab>
<ab n="22">Therefore thus
saith the Lord God, Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
will breake his armes, the strong, and that which was broken; and I
wil cause the sword to fall out of his hand.</ab>
<ab n="23">And I wil
scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and wil disperse them
through the countries.</ab>
<ab n="24">And I wil
strengthen the armes of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in
his hand: but I will breake Pharaohs armes, and he shall grone
before him, with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.</ab>

<fw>The glory, and fall of Assyria.</fw>
<ab n="25">But I wil
strengthen the armes of the king of Babylon, and the armes of
Pharaoh shall fall downe, and they shall knowe that I am the Lord,
when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon,
&amp; he shall stretch it out vpon the land of Egypt.</ab>
<ab n="26">And I wil
scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among
the countreys, and they shall know that I am the Lord.</ab>
