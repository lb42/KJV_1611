<ab n="1">Now when the
aduersaries of Iudah and Beniamin, heard that the children of the
captiuitie builded the Temple vnto the Lord God of
Israel:<note> Hebr. the sonnes of the transportation.</note></ab>

<fw>The building of the Temple,
hindered.</fw>
<ab n="2">Then they came
to Zerubbabel, and to the chiefe of the fathers, and said vnto
them, Let vs build with you, for wee seeke your God, as yee doe,
and we doe sacrifice vnto him, since the dayes of Esar-Haddon king
of Assur, which brought vs vp hither.</ab>
<ab n="3">But Zerubbabel
and Ieshua, and the rest of the chiefe of the fathers of Israel,
said vnto them, You haue nothing to doe with vs, to build an house
vnto our God, but we our selues together will build vnto the Lord
God of Israel, as king Cyrus the King of Persia hath commanded
vs.</ab>
<ab n="4">Then the people
of the land weakened the handes of the people of Iudah, and
troubled them in building,</ab>
<ab n="5">And hired
counsellers against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the dayes
of Cyrus king of Persia, euen vntill the reigne of Darius king of
Persia.</ab>
<ab n="6">And in the
reigne of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reigne, wrote they
vnto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Iudah and
Ierusalem.<note> Heb. Ahashuerosh.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">¶ And in
the dayes of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the
rest of their companions, vnto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the
writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and
interpreted in the Syrian tongue.<note> Or, in peace. , Heb. societies.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Rehum the
Chancellour, and Shimshai the Scribe, wrote a letter against
Ierusalem, to Artaxerxes the king, in this sort:<note> Or, Secretarie.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">Then, wrote
Rehum the Chancellour, and Shimshai the Scribe, and the rest of
their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathkites, the Tarpelites,
the Apharsites, the Archeuites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites,
the Dehauites, and the Elamites,<note> Chald. societies.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">And the rest
of the nations whom the great and noble Asnappar brought ouer, and
set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side
the Riuer, and at such a time.<note> Chal. Cheeneth.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">¶ This is
the copy of the Letter, that they sent vnto him, euen vnto
Artaxerxes the king: Thy seruants on this side the Riuer, and at
such a time,</ab>
<ab n="12">Be it knowen
vnto the king, that the Iewes which came vp from thee to vs, are
come vnto Ierusalem, building the rebellious and the bad citie, and
haue set vp the walles thereof, and ioyned the
foundations.<note> Or, finished , Chal. sowed together.</note></ab>

<fw>The Kings letter, and the
enemies.</fw>
<ab n="13">Be it knowen
now vnto the king, that if this city be builded, and the wals set
vp againe, then will they not pay tolle, tribute, and custome, and
so thou shalt endammage the reuenue of the kings.<note> Chal. giue. , Or, strength.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">Now because we
haue maintenance from the Kings palace, and it was not meete for vs
to see the kings dishonour: therefore haue we sent, and certified
the king,<note> Chal. we are salted with the salt of the palace.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">That search
may be made in the booke of the Records of thy fathers: so shalt
thou finde in the booke of the Records, and know, that this City is
a rebellious city, and hurtfull vnto Kings and prouinces, and that
they haue moued sedition within the same of olde time: for which
cause was this citie destroyed.<note> Cald. made. , Chald. in the midst thereof.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">We certifie
the king, that if this citie be builded againe, &amp; the walles
thereof set vp: by this meanes, thou shalt haue no portion on this
side the Riuer.</ab>
<ab n="17">¶ Then
sent the king an answere vnto Rehum the Chancellour, and to
Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions, that
dwell in Samaria, and vnto the rest beyond the Riuer, Peace, and at
such a time.<note> Chal, societies.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">The letter,
which ye sent vnto vs, hath bene plainly read before me.</ab>
<ab n="19">And I
commaunded, and search hath bene made, and it is found, that this
citie of old time hath made insurrection against Kings, and that
rebellion &amp; sedition haue bene made therein.<note> Chald. by me a decree is set. , Chald. listed vp it selfe.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">There haue
bene mighty Kings also ouer Ierusalem, which haue ruled ouer all
countreys beyond the Riuer, and tolle, tribute, and custome, was
payd vnto them.</ab>
<ab n="21">Giue ye now
commandement, to cause these men to cease, and that this citie be
not builded, vntill another commandement shall be giuen from
me.<note> Chal. make a decree.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">Take heed now
that ye faile not to doe this: why should damage grow to the hurt
of the kings?</ab>
<ab n="23">¶ Now
when the copy of King Artaxerxes letter was read before Rehum and
Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went vp in haste to
Ierusalem, vnto the Iewes, and made them to cease, by force and
power.<note> Chald. by arme and power.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">Then ceased
the woorke of the house of the God, which is at Ierusalem. So it
ceased, vnto the second yeere of the reigne of Darius king of
Persia.</ab>
