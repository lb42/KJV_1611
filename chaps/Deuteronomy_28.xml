hee will bring vpon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast
afraid of, and they shal cleaue vnto thee.</ab>

be left few in number, whereas ye were as the starres of heauen for
multitude: because thou wouldest not obey the voyce of the Lord thy
God.<note> Chap. 10. 22.</note></ab>
<ab n="63">And it shall
come to passe, that as the Lord reioyced ouer you to doe you good,
and to multiply you; so the Lord will reioyce ouer you to destroy
you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shalbe plucked from off the
land whither thou goest to possesse it.</ab>
<ab n="64">And the Lord
shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth,
euen vnto the other: and there thou shalt serue other gods, which
neither thou nor thy fathers haue knowen, euen wood and
stone.</ab>
<ab n="65">And among
these nations shalt thou finde no ease, neither shall the sole of
thy foote haue rest: but the Lord shall giue thee there a trembling
heart, and failing of eyes, &amp; sorrow of minde.</ab>

shall hang in doubt before thee, and thou shalt feare day and
night, and shalt haue none assurance of thy life.</ab>

<fw>Sihon and Og.</fw>
<ab n="67">In the
morning thou shalt say, Would God it were Euen: and at Euen thou
shalt say, Would God it were morning, for the feare of thine heart
wherewith thou shalt feare, and for the sight of thine eyes which
thou shalt see.</ab>
<ab n="68">And the Lord
shall bring thee into Egypt againe, with ships, by the way whereof
I spake vnto thee, Thou shalt see it no more againe: and there ye
shall bee sold vnto your enemies for bondmen, and bondwomen, and no
man shall buy you.</ab>
