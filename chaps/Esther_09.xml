<head>CHAP. IX.</head>
<head>1 The Iewes, (the rulers, for feare
of Mordecai helping them) slay their enemies, with the ten sonnes
of Haman. 12 Ahasuerus at the request of Esther, granteth another
day of slaughter, and Hamans sonnes to be hanged. 20 The two daies
of Purim are made festiuall.</head>

<ab n="1">Now in the
twelfth month (that is the moneth Adar) on the thirteenth day of
the same, when the Kings commaundement and his decree drew neere to
bee put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Iewes
hoped to haue power ouer them: (though it was turned to the
contrary, that the Iewes had rule ouer them that hated
them.)</ab>
<ab n="2">The Iewes
gathered themselues together in their cities, throughout all the
prouinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought
their hurt, and no man could withstand them: for the feare of them
fell vpon all people.</ab>
<ab n="3">And all the
rulers of the prouinces, and the Lieutenants, and the deputies, and
officers of the king, helped the Iewes: because the feare of
Mordecai fell vpon them.<note> Heb. those which did the busines that belonged to the King.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">For Mordecai
was great in the kings house, and his fame went out, throughout all
the prouinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and
greater.</ab>

<fw>Hamans ten sonnes.</fw>
<ab n="5">Thus the
Iewes smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and
slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would vnto those that
hated them.<note> Heb. according to their will.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">And in
Shushan the palace the Iewes slew and destroyed fiue hundred
men:</ab>
<ab n="7">And
Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,</ab>
<ab n="8">And Poratha,
and Adalia, and Aridatha,</ab>
<ab n="9">And
Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Uaiezatha,</ab>
<ab n="10">The ten sonnes of
Haman the sonne of Hammedatha, the enemie of the Iewes, slew they,
but on the spoile laid they not their hand.</ab>
<ab n="11">On that day, the
number of those that were slaine in Shushan the palace, was brought
before the king.<note> Heb. came.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">¶ And the
king said vnto Esther the Queene; The Iewes haue slaine and
destroied fiue hundred men in Shushan the palace, &amp; the ten
sonnes of Haman; what haue they done in the rest of the kings
prouinces? now what is thy petition? and it shalbe granted thee: or
what is thy request further? and it shall be done.</ab>
<ab n="13">Then said Esther,
If it please the king, Let it bee granted to the Iewes which are in
Shushan, to doe to morow also, according vnto this dayes decree,
and let Hamans ten sonnes be hanged vpon the gallous.<note> Hebr. let men hang.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And the king
commanded it so to be done; and the decree was giuen at Shushan,
and they hanged Hamans ten sonnes.</ab>
<ab n="15">For the Iewes that
were in Shushan, gathered themselues together on the fourteenth day
also of the moneth Adar, and slewe three hundred men at Shushan:
but on the pray they laid not their hand.</ab>
<ab n="16">But the other
Iewes that were in the kings prouinces, gathered themselues
together, &amp; stood for their liues, and had rest from their
enemies, and slew of their foes seuenty and fiue thousand, but they
laid not their handes on the pray.</ab>
<ab n="17">On the thirteenth
day of the moneth Adar, and on the fourteenth day of the same,
rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladnes.<note> Heb. in it.</note></ab>

<fw>A new Feast is ordeined.</fw>
<ab n="18">But the Iewes that
were at Shushan, assembled together on the thirteenth day therof,
and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the
same, they rested, and made it a day of feasting and
gladnesse.</ab>
<ab n="19">Therefore the
Iewes of the villages, that dwelt in the vnwalled townes, made the
foureteenth day of the moneth Adar, a day of gladnesse and
feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to
another.</ab>
<ab n="20">¶ And
Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters vnto all the Iewes,
that were in all the prouinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh
&amp; farre,</ab>
<ab n="21">To stablish this
among them, that they should keepe the fourteenth day of the moneth
Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yeerely:</ab>
<ab n="22">As the dayes
wherein the Iewes rested from their enemies, &amp; the moneth which
was turned vnto them, from sorrow to ioy, and from mourning into a
good day: that they should make them daies of feasting and ioy, and
of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poore.</ab>
<ab n="23">And the Iewes
vndertooke to doe, as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written
vnto them:</ab>
<ab n="24">Because Haman the
sonne of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemie of all the Iewes, had
deuised against the Iewes to destroy them, and had cast Pur (that
is, the lot) to consume them, and to destroy them.<note> Heb. crush.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">But when Esther
came before the king, he commanded by letters, that his wicked
deuice which he deuised against the Iewes, should returne vpon his
owne head, and that he and his sonnes, should be hanged on the
gallous.<note> Heb. when she came.</note></ab>
<ab n="26">Wherefore they
called these dayes Purim, after the name of Pur: therefore for all
the words of this letter, and of that which they had seene
concerning this matter, and which had come vnto them,<note> That is, Lot.</note></ab>

<fw>A new Feast is ordeined.</fw>
<ab n="27">The Iewes
ordeined, and tooke vpon them, and vpon their seed, and vpon all
such as ioyned themselues vnto them, so as it should not faile,
that they would keepe these two dayes, according to their writing,
and according to their appointed time, euery yeere:<note> Hebr. passe.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">And that these
dayes should be remembred, and kept throughout euery generation,
euery family, euery prouince, and euery citie, and that these dayes
of Purim should not faile from among the Iewes, nor the memoriall
of them perish from their seed.<note> Heb. passe. , Hebr. be ended.</note></ab>
<ab n="29">Then Esther the
Queene, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Iew, wrote with
all authoritie, to confirme this second letter of
Purim.<note> Hebr. all strength.</note></ab>
<ab n="30">And hee sent the
letters vnto all the Iewes, to the hundred, twentie and seuen
prouinces of the kingdome of Ahasuerus, with wordes of peace and
trueth:</ab>
<ab n="31">To confirme these
dayes of Purim, in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the
Iew, and Esther the Queene had enioyned them, and as they had
decreed for themselues and for their seed, the matters of the
fastings and their cry.<note> Hebr for their soules.</note></ab>
<ab n="32">And the decree of
Esther confirmed these matters of Purim, and it was written in the
booke.</ab>
