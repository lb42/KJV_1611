the Nineuites. 5 Vpon their repentance, 10 God

<ab n="1">And the word
of þe Lordcame vnto Ionah the second time,
saying;</ab>
<ab n="2">Arise, goe
vnto Nineueh that great citie, and preach vnto it the preaching
that I bid thee.</ab>
<ab n="3">So Ionah arose
and went vnto Nineueh, according to the word of the Lord: now
Nineueh was an exceeding great citie of three dayes
iourney.<note> Heb. of God.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">And Ionah
began to enter into the citie a dayes iourney, and hee cryed, and
said; Yet fourtie dayes, and Niniueh shalbe ouerthrowen.</ab>
<ab n="5">¶ So the
people of Nineueh beleeued God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on
sackecloth from the greatest of them euen to the least of
them.<note> Matth.12. 41. luke 11.32.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">For word came
vnto the King of Nineueh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid
his robe from him and couered him with sackcloth, &amp; sate in
ashes.</ab>

<fw>Gods mercy.</fw>
<ab n="7">And he caused
it to be proclaimed and published through Nineueh (by the decree of
the King and his nobles) saying; Let neither man nor beast, herd
nor flocke taste any thing; let them not feede, nor drinke
water.<note> Heb. said. , Heb. great men.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">But let man
and beast be couered with sackecloth, and cry mightily vnto God:
yea, let them turne euery one from his euill way, and from the
violence that is in their hands.</ab>
<ab n="9">Who can tell
if God will turne and repent, and turne away from his fierce anger,
that we perish not?<note> Ioel 2.14.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">¶ And God saw
their workes, that they turned from their euill way, and God
repented of the euill that hee had sayd, that he would doe vnto
them, and he did it not.</ab>
