<fw>Manna is loathed.</fw>
<ab n="1">And when the
people complained, it displeased the Lord: and the Lord heard it:
and his anger was kindled, and the fire of the Lord burnt among
them, and consumed them that were in the vttermost parts of the
campe.<note> Or, were as it were complainers.. , Heb. it was euill in the eares of &amp;c. , Psal.78. 21.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And the people
cried vnto Moses, and when Moses prayed vnto the Lord, the fire was
quenched.<note> Hebr. sunke.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And hee called
the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the Lord burnt
among them.<note> That is, a burning.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">¶ And the
mixt multitude that was among them, fell a lusting, and the
children of Israel also wept againe, and said, Who shal giue vs
flesh to eate?<note> As Exod. 12.38. , Heb. lusted a lust. , Hebr. returned and wept. , 1.Cor.10. 6.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">We remember the
fish which wee did eate in Egypt freely: the cucumbers and the
melons, and the leekes, and the onions, and the garlicke.</ab>
<ab n="6">But now our soule
is dried away, there is nothing at all, besides this Manna, before
our eyes.</ab>
<ab n="7">And the Manna was
as Coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of
Bdelium:<note> Exod. 16. 14, 31. , Hebr. eye of it, as the eye of.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">And the people
went about, and gathered it, and ground it in milles, or beat it in
a morter, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste
of it was as the taste of fresh oyle.</ab>
<ab n="9">And when the dew
fell vpon the campe in the night, the Manna fell vpon it.</ab>
<ab n="10">¶ Then
Moses heard the people weepe throughout their families, euery man
in the doore of his tent, and the anger of the Lord was kindled
greatly, Moses also was displeased.</ab>
<ab n="11">And Moses said
vnto the Lord, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy seruant? and
wherefore haue I not found fauour in thy sight, that thou layest
the burden of all this people vpon me?</ab>
<ab n="12">Haue I conceiued
all this people? haue I begotten them, that thou shouldest say vnto
me, Cary them in thy bosome (as a nursing father beareth the
sucking child) vnto the land which thou swarest vnto their
fathers?</ab>

<fw>Seuenty Elders.</fw>
<ab n="13">Whence should I
haue flesh to giue vnto all this people? for they weep vnto me,
saying, Giue vs flesh, that we may eate.</ab>
<ab n="14">I am not able to
beare all this people alone, because it is too heauie for
mee.</ab>
<ab n="15">And if thou
deale thus with mee, kill me, I pray thee out of hand, if I haue
found fauour in thy sight, and let me not see my
wretchednesse.</ab>
<ab n="16">¶ And the
Lord said vnto Moses, Gather vnto me seuentie men, of the Elders of
Israel, whome thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and
officers ouer them: and bring them vnto the Tabernacle of the
Congregation, that they may stand there with thee.</ab>
<ab n="17">And I will come
downe and talke with thee there, and I will take of the spirit
which is vpon thee, and wil put it vpon them, and they shall beare
the burden of the people with thee, that thou beare it not thy
selfe alone.</ab>
<ab n="18">And say thou
vnto the people, Sanctifie your selues against to morrow, and yee
shall eate flesh: (for you haue wept in the eares of the Lord,
saying, Who shall giue vs flesh to eate? for it was well with vs in
Egypt:) therfore the Lord wil giue you flesh, and ye shall
eate.</ab>
<ab n="19">Ye shall not
eate one day, nor two dayes, nor fiue dayes, neither ten dayes, nor
twentie dayes:</ab>
<ab n="20">But euen a whole
moneth, vntill it come out at your nostrels, and it bee loathsome
vnto you, because that yee haue despised the Lord which is among
you, and haue wept before him, saying, Why came we foorth out of
Egypt?<note> Heb. moneth of dayes.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">And Moses said,
The people amongst whome I am, are sixe hundred thousand footmen,
and thou hast said, I will giue them flesh, that they may eate a
whole moneth.</ab>
<ab n="22">Shall the
flockes and the herds be slaine for them to suffice them? or shal
all the fish of the sea bee gathered together for them, to suffice
them?</ab>
<ab n="23">And the Lord
said vnto Moses, Is the Lords hand waxed short? thou shalt see now
whether my word shall come to passe vnto thee, or not.<note> Esa.50.2. and 59.1.</note></ab>

<fw>Eldad and Medad.</fw>
<ab n="24">¶ And Moses
went out, and tolde the people the wordes of the Lord, and gathered
the seuenty men of the Elders of the people, and set them round
about the Tabernacle.</ab>
<ab n="25">And the Lord
came downe in a cloude, and spake vnto him, and tooke of the spirit
that was vpon him, and gaue it vnto the seuentie Elders: and it
came to passe that when the spirit rested vpon them, they
prophesied, and did not cease.</ab>
<ab n="26">But there
remained two of the men in the campe, the name of the one was
Eldad, &amp; the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested
vpon them, (and they were of them that were written, but went not
out vnto the Tabernacle) and they prophesied in the campe.</ab>
<ab n="27">And there ranne
a yong man, and tolde Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad doe
prophesie in the campe.</ab>
<ab n="28">And Ioshua the
sonne of Nun the seruant of Moses, one of his yong men, answered
and said, My lord Moses, Forbid them.</ab>
<ab n="29">And Moses said
vnto him, Enuiest thou for my sake? Would God that all the Lords
people were Prophets, and that the Lord would put his Spirit vpon
them.</ab>
<ab n="30">And Moses gate
him into the campe, he, and the Elders of Israel.</ab>
<ab n="31">¶ And there
went forth a winde from the Lord, and brought quailes from the sea,
and let them fall by the campe, as it were a dayes iourney on this
side, and as it were a dayes iourney on the other side round about
the campe, and as it were two cubits high vpon the face of the
earth.<note> Exod.16. 13. psal.78. 26. , Hebr. as it were the way of a day.</note></ab>
<ab n="32">And the people
stood vp all that day, and all that night, and all the next day,
and they gathered the quailes: he that gathered least, gathered ten
homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselues round about
the campe.</ab>
<ab n="33">And while the
flesh was yet betweene their teeth, yer it was chewed, the wrath of
the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote the
people with a very great plague.<note> Psal.78. 31.</note></ab>
<ab n="34">And he called
the name of that place, Kibroth-Hattaauah: because there they
buried the people that lusted.<note> That is, The graues of lust.</note></ab>
<ab n="35">And the people
iourneyed from Kibroth-Hattaauah, vnto Hazeroth: and abode at
Hazeroth.<note> Hebr. they were in, &amp;c.</note></ab>
