<ab n="1">And it came to
passe in those dayes, that there went out a decree from Cesar
Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.<note> Or, inrolled.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">(And this
taxing was first made whē Cyrenius was gouernor of
Syria)</ab>
<ab n="3">And all went to
bee taxed, euery one into his owne citie.</ab>

<fw>Christ is borne.</fw>
<ab n="4">And Ioseph also
wēt vp frō Galilee, out of the citie of Nazareth, into
Iudea, vnto the citie of Dauid, which is called Bethlehem, (because
he was of the house and linage of Dauid,)<note> Iohn 7.42.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">To be taxed
with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</ab>
<ab n="6">And so it was,
that while they were there, the dayes were accomplished that she
should be deliuered.</ab>
<ab n="7">And she brought
foorth her first borne sonne, and wrapped him in swadling clothes,
and laid him in a manger, because there was no roome for them in
the Inne.</ab>
<ab n="8">And there were
in the same countrey shepheards abiding in þe
field, keeping watch ouer their flocke by night.<note> Or, the night watches.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And loe, the
Angel of the Lord came vpon them, and the glory of the Lord shone
round about them, and they were sore afraid.</ab>
<ab n="10">And the Angel
said vnto them, Feare not: For behold, I bring you good tidings of
great ioy, which shall be to all people.</ab>
<ab n="11">For vnto you
is borne this day, in the citie of Dauid, a Sauiour, which is
Christ the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="12">And this shall
be a signe vnto you; yee shall find the babe wrapped in swadling
clothes lying in a manger.</ab>
<ab n="13">And suddenly
there was with the Angel a multitude of the heauenly hoste praising
God, and saying,</ab>
<ab n="14">Glory to God
in the highest, and on earth peace, good wil towards men.</ab>
<ab n="15">And it came to
passe, as the Angels were gone away from them into heauen, the
shepheards said one to another, Let vs now goe euen vnto Bethlehem,
and see this thing which is come to passe, which the Lord hath made
knowen vnto vs.</ab>
<ab n="16">And they came
with haste, and found Mary and Ioseph, and the babe lying in a
manger.</ab>
<ab n="17">And when they
had seene it, they made knowen abroad the saying, which was told
them, concerning this child.</ab>
<ab n="18">And all they
that heard it, wondered at those things, which were tolde them by
the shepheards.</ab>
<ab n="19">But Mary kept
all these things, and pondered them in her heart.</ab>
<ab n="20">And the
shepheards returned, glorifying &amp; praising God for all the
things that they had heard and seene, as it was told vnto
them.</ab>

<fw>Simeons song.</fw>
<ab n="21">And when eight
dayes were accomplished for the circumcising of the childe, his
name was called Iesus, which was so named of the Angel before he
was conceiued in the wombe.<note> Gen.17. 12. , Mat.1. 21.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">And when the
dayes of her purification according to the law of Moses, were
accomplished, they brought him to Hierusalem, to present him to the
Lord,</ab>
<ab n="23">(As it is
written in the law of the Lord, Euery male that openeth the wombe,
shalbe called holy to the Lord)<note> Exod. 13. 2. numb. 18 16.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">And to offer a
sacrifice according to that which is said in the Law of the Lord, a
paire of turtle doues, or two yong pigeons.<note> Leuit.12. 2,6.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">And behold,
there was a man in Hierusalem, whose name was Simeon, and the same
man was iust and deuout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and
the holy Ghost was vpon him.</ab>
<ab n="26">And it was
reuealed vnto him by the holy Ghost, that he should not see death,
before he had seene the Lords Christ.</ab>
<ab n="27">And hee came
by the spirit into the Temple: and when the parents brought in the
child Iesus, to doe for him after the custome of the Lawe,</ab>
<ab n="28">Then tooke hee
him vp in his armes, and blessed God, and said,</ab>
<ab n="29">Lord now
lettest thou thy seruant depart in peace, according to thy
word.</ab>
<ab n="30">For mine eyes
haue seene thy saluation.</ab>
<ab n="31">Which thou
hast prepared before the face of all people.</ab>
<ab n="32">A light to
lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.</ab>
<ab n="33">And Ioseph and
his mother marueiled at those things which were spoken of
him.</ab>
<ab n="34">And Simeon
blessed them, and said vnto Marie his mother, Behold, this child is
set for the fall and rising againe of many in Israel: and for a
signe which shall be spoken against,<note> Esai. 8. 14. rom.9.32.</note></ab>
<ab n="35">(Yea a sword
shall pearce thorow thy owne soule also) that the thoughts of many
hearts may be reuealed.</ab>
<ab n="36">And there was
one Anna a Prophetesse, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of
Aser; she was of a great age, and had liued with an husband seuen
yeeres from her virginitie.</ab>

<fw>Christ obedient, Iohns preaching, and
baptisme</fw>
<ab n="37">And she was a
widow of about fourescore and foure yeeres, which departed not from
the Temple, but serued God with fastings and prayers night and
day.</ab>
<ab n="38">And she
comming in that instant, gaue thankes likewise vnto the Lord, and
spake of him to al them that looked for redemption in
Hierusalem.<note> Or, Israel.</note></ab>
<ab n="39">And when they
had performed all things according to the Lawe of the Lord, they
returned into Galilee, to their owne citie Nazareth.</ab>
<ab n="40">And the child
grew, and waxed strong in spirit filled with wisedome, and the
grace of God was vpon him.</ab>
<ab n="41">Now his
parents went to Hierusalem euery yeere, at the feast of the
Passeouer.<note> Deu. 16. 1.</note></ab>
<ab n="42">And when he
was twelue yeeres old, they went vp to Hierusalem, after the
custome of the feast.</ab>
<ab n="43">And when they
had fulfilled the dayes, as they returned, the childe Iesus taried
behind in Hierusalem, and Ioseph and his mother knew not of
it.</ab>
<ab n="44">But they
supposing him to haue bene in the company, went a daies iourney,
and they sought him among their kinsefolke and
acquaintance.</ab>
<ab n="45">And when they
found him not, they turned backe againe to Hierusalem, seeking
him.</ab>
<ab n="46">And it came to
passe, that after three daies they found him in the Temple, sitting
in the midst of the Doctours, both hearing them, and asking them
questions.</ab>
<ab n="47">And all that
heard him were astonished at his vnderstanding, and
answeres.</ab>
<ab n="48">And when they
sawe him, they were amazed: and his mother said vnto him, Sonne,
why hast thou thus dealt with vs? Behold, thy father and I haue
sought thee sorrowing.</ab>
<ab n="49">And he said
vnto them, How is it that ye sought me? Wist yee not that I must
bee about my fathers businesse?</ab>
<ab n="50">And they
vnderstood not the saying which he spake vnto them.</ab>
<ab n="51">And he went
downe with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subiect vnto them:
But his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</ab>
<ab n="52">And Iesus
increased in wisedom and stature, and in fauour with God and
man.<note> Or, age.</note></ab>
