their impenitencie.</head>

<ab n="1">Neuerthelesse
the dimnesse shall not be such as was in her vexation; when at the

of the Sea, beyond Iordan in Galile of the nations.<note> Or, populous.</note></ab>

<ab n="5">For euery
battell of the warriour is with confused noise, and garments rolled

vpon his shoulder: and his name shalbe called, Wonderfull,
Counseller, The mightie God, The euerlasting Father, The Prince of
peace.<note> Ioh. 3.16.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">Of the
increase of his gouernment and peace there shall be no end, vpon
the throne of Dauid &amp; vpon his kingdome, to order it, and to
stablish it with iudgement and with iustice, from henceforth euen
for euer: the zeale of the Lord of hostes will performe
this.<note> Luke 1. 32,33. , 2.Kings 19.31. chap.37.32</note></ab>

people shal know, euen Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that
say in the pride and stoutnesse of heart;</ab>
<ab n="10">The brickes are
fallen downe, but we will build with hewen stones: the Sycomores

shall set vp the aduersaries of Rezin against him, and ioyne his
enemies together.<note> Heb. mingle.</note></ab>

before, and the Philistines behinde, and they shall deuoure Israel
with open mouth: for all this his anger is not turned away, but his
hand is stretched out still.<note> Heb. with whole mouth. , Chap.5. 25. &amp; 10.4</note></ab>
<ab n="13">¶ For the
people turneth not vnto him that smiteth them, neither doe they
seeke the Lord of hostes.</ab>
<ab n="14">Therefore the Lord
will cut off from Israel head and taile, branch and rush in one
day.</ab>

honourable, hee is the head: and the prophet that teacheth lies, he
is the taile.</ab>

this people cause them to erre, and they that are ledde of them,
are destroyed.<note> Or, they that call them blessed. , Or, they that are called blessed of them. , Heb. swallowed vp.</note></ab>

<fw>Wicked law-makers.</fw>
<ab n="17">Therfore the Lord
shall haue no ioy in their yong men, neither shall haue mercy on
their fatherlesse &amp; widowes: for euery one is an hypocrite, and
an euil doer, and euery mouth speaketh folly: for all this his
anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out
still.<note> Or, villeny.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">¶ For
wickednes burneth as the fire: it shall deuoure the briers and
thornes, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forrest, and they
shall mount vp like the lifting vp of smoke.</ab>

of the Lord of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be
as the fuell of the fire: no man shall spare his
brother.<note> Heb. meat.</note></ab>

and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shalbe against Iudah: for
all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched
out still.</ab>
