<head>CHAP. V.</head>
<head>1 Being iustified by faith, wee haue
peace with God, 2 and ioy in our hope, 8 that sith we were
reconciled by his blood, when wee were enemies, 10 wee shall much
more be saued being reconciled. 12 As sinne and death came by Adam,
17 so much more righteousnesse and life by Iesus Christ. 20 Where
sinne abounded, grace did superabound.</head>

<ab n="1">Therefore
being iustified by faith, wee haue peace with God, through our Lord
Iesus Christ.</ab>
<ab n="2">By whom also
wee haue accesse by faith, into this grace wherein wee stand, and
reioyce in hope of the glory of God.</ab>
<ab n="3">And not onely
so, but we glory in tribulations also, knowing that tribulation
worketh patience:</ab>
<ab n="4">And patience,
experience: and experience, hope:</ab>
<ab n="5">And hope
maketh not ashamed, because the loue of God is shed abroad in our
hearts, by the holy Ghost, which is giuen vnto vs.</ab>
<ab n="6">For when wee
were yet without strength, in due time, Christ died for the
vngodly.<note> Or, according to the time.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">For scarcely
for a righteous man will one die: yet peraduenture for a good man,
some would euen dare to dye.</ab>

<fw>Gods loue.</fw>
<ab n="8">But God
commendeth his loue towards vs, in that, while we were yet sinners,
Christ died for vs.</ab>
<ab n="9">Much more
then being now iustified by his blood, we shalbe saued from wrath
through him.</ab>
<ab n="10">For if when wee
were enemies, we were reconciled to God, by the death of his sonne:
much more being reconciled, we shalbe saued by his life.</ab>
<ab n="11">And not onely so,
but wee also ioy in God, through our Lorde Iesus Christ, by whom we
haue now receiued the atonement.</ab>
<ab n="12">Wherefore, as by
one man sinne entred into the world, and death by sin: and so death
passed vpon all men, for that all haue sinned.<note> Or, in whom</note></ab>
<ab n="13">For vntill the Law
sinne was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no
Law.</ab>
<ab n="14">Neuertheles, death
reigned from Adam to Moses, euen ouer them that had not sinned
after the similitude of Adams transgression, who is the figure of
him that was to come:</ab>
<ab n="15">But not as the
offence, so also is the free gift: for if through the offence of
one, many bee dead: much more the grace of God, and the gift by
grace, which is by one man Iesus Christ, hath abounded vnto
many.</ab>
<ab n="16">And not as it was
by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the iudgement was by one to
condemnation: but the free gift is of many offences vnto
iustification.</ab>
<ab n="17">For if by one mans
offence, death raigned by one, much more they which receiue
abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousnes, shall reigne in
life by one, Iesus Christ.<note> Or, by one offence.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Therfore as by the
offence of one, iudgment came vpon all men to condemnation: euen so
by the righteousnes of one, the free gift came vpon all men vnto
iustification of life.<note> Or, by one offence. , Or, by one righteousnes</note></ab>
<ab n="19">For as by one mans
disobedience many were made sinners: so by the obedience of one,
shall many bee made righteous.</ab>
<ab n="20">Moreouer, the Lawe
entred, that the offence might abound: but where sinne abounded,
grace did much more abound.</ab>
<ab n="21">That as sinne hath
reigned vnto death; euen so might grace reigne thorow righteousnes
vnto eternall life, by Iesus Christ our Lord.</ab>
