times haue ye reproched me: you are not ashamed that you make your
selues strange to me.<note> Or, harden your selues against me.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">And be it
indeed that I haue erred, mine errour remaineth with my
selfe.</ab>
<ab n="5">If indeed yee
will magnifie your selues against me, and plead against me my
reproch:</ab>
<ab n="6">Know now that
God hath ouerthrowen me, and hath compassed me with his
net.</ab>
<ab n="7">Behold, I cry
out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloude, but there is no

vp my way that I cannot passe; and hee hath set darkenesse in my
pathes.</ab>
<ab n="9">Hee hath stript
me of my glory, and taken the crowne from my head.</ab>
<ab n="10">He hath
destroyed me on euery side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he
remooued like a tree.</ab>

kindled his wrath against me, and hee counteth me vnto him as one
of his enemies.</ab>

mouth.</ab>
<ab n="17">My breath is
strange to my wife, though I entreated for the childrens sake of

children despised me; I arose, and they spake against
me.<note> Or, the wicked.</note></ab>

grauen with an iron pen and lead, in the rocke for euer.</ab>

that my Redeemer liueth, and that he shall stand at the latter day,

after my skin, wormes destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I
see God:<note> Or, After I shall awake through this body be destroyed, yet out of my flesh shall I see God.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">Whom I shal
see for my selfe, and mine eyes shall beholde, and not another,
though my reines bee consumed within me.<note> Hebr. a stranger. , Hebr. in my bosome.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">But ye should
say, Why persecute we him? seeing the root of the matter is found
in me.<note> Or, and what roote of matter is found in me?</note></ab>
<ab n="29">Bee ye afraid
of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that
yee may know there is a iudgement.</ab>
