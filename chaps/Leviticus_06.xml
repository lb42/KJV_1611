neighbour in that which was deliuered him to keepe, or in
fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceiued
his neighbour:<note> Or, in dealing. , Heb. putting of the hand.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">Or haue found
that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsly:
in any of all these that a man doth, sinning therein:<note> Num. 5.6.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">Then it shall
be, because he hath sinned, and is guiltie, that hee shall restore
that which he tooke violently away, or the thing which he hath
deceitfully gotten, or that which was deliuered him to keepe, or
the lost thing which he found:</ab>
<ab n="5">Or all that
about which hee hath sworne falsly: hee shall euen restore it in
the principall, and shall adde the fift part more thereto, and giue
it vnto him to whom it apperteineth, in the day of his trespasse
offering.<note> Chap.5. 15. , Or, in the day of his being found guilty. Heb. the day of his trespasse.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">And hee shall
bring his trespasse offering vnto the Lord, a ramme without blemish
out of the flocke, with thy estimation, for a trespasse offering
vnto the Priest.<note> Chap.5. 15.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">And the Priest
shall make an atonement for him, before the Lord: and it shall bee
forgiuen him, for any thing of all that he hath done, in
trespassing therein.</ab>
<ab n="8">¶ And the
Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,</ab>
<ab n="9">Command Aaron
and his sonnes, saying, This is the law of the burnt offring: (It
is the burnt offring, because of the burning vpon the Altar all
night vnto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning
in it.)<note> Or, for the burning.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">And the Priest
shal put on his linnen garment, &amp; his linnen breeches shal he
put vpon his flesh, and take vp the ashes which the fire hath
consumed with the burnt offering on the Altar, and he shall put
them besides the Altar.</ab>

<fw>Burnt offering.</fw>
<ab n="11">And he shal put
off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry foorth the
ashes without the Campe, vnto a cleane place.</ab>
<ab n="12">And the fire
vpon the Altar shall be burning in it: it shall not be put out; And
the Priest shall burne wood on it euery morning, and lay the burnt
offering in order vpon it, and he shall burne thereon the fatte of
the peace offerings.</ab>
<ab n="13">The fire shall
euer be burning vpon the Altar: it shall neuer goe out.</ab>
<ab n="14">¶ And this
is the law of the meat offering: the sonnes of Aaron shall offer it
before the Lord, before the Altar.<note> Chap. 21. 1. num.15, 4.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">And he shall
take of it his handfull, of the flowre of the meat offering, and of
the oyle therof, and all the frankincense which is vpon the meat
offring, and shall burne it vpon the Altar, for a sweet sauour,
euen the memoriall of it vnto the Lord.<note> Chap.2.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">And the
remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sonnes eat: with vnleauened
bread shall it be eaten in the holy place: in the court of the
Tabernacle of the Congregation they shall eat it.</ab>
<ab n="17">It shall not be
baken with leauen: I haue giuen it vnto them for their portion of
my offerings made by fire: it is most holy, as is the sin offering,
and as the trespasse offering.</ab>
<ab n="18">All the males
among the children of Aaron shall eat of it: It shalbe a statute
for euer in your generations concerning the offerings of the Lord
made by fire: euery one that toucheth them shalbe holy.<note> Exod. 29. 37.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">¶ And the
Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,</ab>
<ab n="20">This is the
offering of Aaron, and of his sonnes which they shall offer vnto
the Lord, in the day when he is anoynted: The tenth part of an
Ephah of fine flowre for a meat offering perpetuall, halfe of it in
the morning, and halfe thereof at night.<note> Exod. 16. 36.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">In a panne it
shalbe made with oyle, and when it is baken, thou shalt bring it
in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for
a sweet sauour vnto the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="22">And the Priest
of his sonnes that is anoynted in his stead, shal offer it: It is a
statute for euer vnto the Lord, it shalbe wholly burnt.</ab>
<ab n="23">For euery meat
offering for the Priest shal be wholly burnt: it shall not be
eaten.</ab>

<fw>Meat offering.</fw>
<ab n="24">¶ And the
Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,</ab>
<ab n="25">Speake vnto
Aaron and to his sonnes, saying, This is the law of the sinne
offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed, shall
the sinne offering be killed before the Lord: it is most
holy.</ab>
<ab n="26">The Priest that
offereth it for sinne, shall eat it: In the holy place shal it be
eaten, in the court of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.</ab>
<ab n="27">Whatsoeuer
shall touch the flesh thereof, shalbe holy: and when there is
sprinckled of the blood thereof vpon any garment, thou shalt wash
that whereon it was sprinckled, in the holy place.</ab>
<ab n="28">But the earthen
vessell wherein it is sodden, shall be broken: And if it be sodden
in a brasen pot, it shall be both scowred, and rinsed in
water.<note> Chap.11. 33.</note></ab>
<ab n="29">All the males
among the Priests shall eate thereof: it is most holy.</ab>
<ab n="30">And no sinne
offering whereof any of the blood is brought into the Tabernacle of
the Congregation to reconcile withall in the holy place, shall be
eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.<note> Hebr.13. 11.</note></ab>
