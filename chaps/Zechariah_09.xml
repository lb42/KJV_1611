eyes.</ab>
<ab n="9">¶ Reioyce
greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout O daughter of Ierusalem:

with whirlewinds of the South.</ab>

hostes shall defend them, and they shall deuoure, and subdue with
sling stones, and they shal drinke and make a noise, as through

their God shall saue them in that day as the flock of his people,

is his goodnesse, and how great is his beautie? corne shal make the
yong men cheerefull, and new wine the maides.<note> Or, grow, or speake.</note></ab>
