<head>CHAP. I.</head>
<head>4 Hee reioyceth to heare of the
faith and loue of Philemon, 9 Whom he desireth to forgiue his
seruant Onesimus, and louingly to receiue him againe.</head>

<ab n="1">Paul a prisoner
of Iesus Christ, &amp; Timothie our brother vnto Philemon our
dearely beloued, and fellow labourer,</ab>
<ab n="2">And to our
beloued Apphia, and Archippus our fellow Souldier, and to the
Church in thy house.</ab>
<ab n="3">Grace to you, and
peace from God our Father, and the Lord Iesus Christ.</ab>
<ab n="4">I thanke my God,
making mention of thee alwayes in my prayers,</ab>
<ab n="5">Hearing of thy
loue, and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Iesus, and toward
all Saints:</ab>
<ab n="6">That the
communication of thy faith may become effectuall by the
acknowledging of euery good thing, which is in you in Christ
Iesus.</ab>
<ab n="7">For wee haue
great ioy and consolation in thy loue, because the bowels of the
Saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</ab>
<ab n="8">Wherefore, though
I might bee much bolde in Christ to enioyne thee that which is
conuenient;</ab>

<fw>Pauls request for Onesimus.</fw>
<ab n="9">Yet for loues
sake I rather beseech thee, being such a one as Paul the aged, and
now also a prisoner of Iesus Christ.</ab>
<ab n="10">I beseech thee
for my sonne Onesimus, whome I haue begotten in my bonds,</ab>
<ab n="11">Which in time
past was to thee vnprofitable: but now profitable to thee and to
me:</ab>
<ab n="12">Whom I haue sent
againe: thou therfore receiue him, that is mine owne
bowels.</ab>
<ab n="13">Whome I would
haue reteined with mee, that in thy stead hee might haue ministred
vnto me in the bonds of the Gospel.</ab>
<ab n="14">But without thy
minde would I doe nothing, that thy benefite should not bee as it
were of necessitie, but willingly.</ab>
<ab n="15">For perhaps hee
therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receiue him
for euer:</ab>
<ab n="16">Not now as a
seruant, but aboue a seruant, a brother beloued, specially to mee,
but how much more vnto thee, both in the flesh, and in the
Lord?</ab>
<ab n="17">If thou count
mee therefore a partner, receiue him as my selfe.</ab>
<ab n="18">If hee hath
wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine
account.</ab>

<fw>Christ aboue the Angels.</fw>
<ab n="19">I Paul haue
written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I doe not
say to thee how thou owest vnto me, euen thine owne selfe
besides:</ab>
<ab n="20">Yea, brother,
let mee haue ioy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowles in the
Lord.</ab>
<ab n="21">Hauing
confidence in thy obedience, I wrote vnto thee, knowing that thou
wilt also doe more then I say.</ab>
<ab n="22">But withall
prepare mee also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I
shall be giuen vnto you.</ab>
<ab n="23">There salute
thee Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Iesus:</ab>
<ab n="24">Marcus,
Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow labourers.</ab>
<ab n="25">The grace of our
Lord Iesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.Written from Rome to
Philemon, by Onesimus a seruant.</ab>
