<head>CHAP. V.</head>
<head>5 Achior telleth Holofernes what the
Iewes are, 8 and what their God had done for them: 21 and aduiseth
not to meddle with them. 22 All that heard him, were offended at
him.</head>

<ab n="1">Then was it
declared to Holofernes the chief captaine of the armie of Assur
that the children of Israel had prepared for warre, and had shut vp
the passages of the hill countrey, and had fortified all the tops
of the high hilles, and had laide impediments in the champion
countreys.<note> Gre. all the toppe.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">Wherewith he
was very angry, and called all the princes of Moab, and the
captaines of Ammon, and all the gouernours of the Sea
coast.</ab>
<ab n="3">And he said
vnto them, Tell mee now, ye sonnes of Canaan, who this people is
that dwelleth in the hill countrey? and what are the cities that
they inhabite? and what is the multitude of their armie? and
wherein is their power and strength, and what king is set ouer
them, or captaine of their armie?</ab>
<ab n="4">And why haue
they determined not to come and meet me, more then all the
inhabitants of the West?</ab>
<ab n="5">Then said
Achior, the captaine of all the sonnes of Ammon: Let my lord now
heare a word from the mouth of thy seruant, and I will declare vnto
thee the trueth, concerning this people which dwelleth neere thee,
and inhabiteth the hill countreys: and there shall no lie come out
of the mouth of thy seruant.<note> Chap. 11. 7, 9.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">This people
are descended of the Caldeans,</ab>
<ab n="7">And they
soiourned heretofore in Mesopotamia, because they would not follow
the gods of their fathers, which were in the land of
Caldea.<note> Gen. 11. 31.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">For they left
the way of their ancestours, and worshipped the God of heauen, the
God whom they knew: so they cast them out from the face of their
gods, and they fled into Mesopotamia, and soiourned there many
dayes.<note> Or, went out of.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">Then their
God commaunded them to depart from the place where they soiourned,
and to goe into the land of Chanaan, where they dwelt, and were
increased with gold and siluer, and with very much
cattell.<note> Gen.12.1.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">But when a famine
couered all the land of Chanaan, they went downe into Egypt, and
soiourned there, while they were nourished, and became there a
great multitude, so that one could not number their nation.</ab>
<ab n="11">Therefore the king
of Egypt rose vp against them, and dealt subtilly with them, and
brought them low, with labouring in bricke, &amp; made them
slaues.<note> Exod.1.8.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">Then they cried
vnto their God, and he smote all the land of Egypt with incurable
plagues, so the Egyptians cast them out of their sight.<note> Exod.12. 31, 33.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">And God dried the
red Sea before them:<note> Exod.14. 21.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And brought them
to mount Sina, and Cades Barne, and cast forth all that dwelt in
the wildernesse.<note> Exod.19.1 , Greek into the way of the wildernes of Sins.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">So they dwelt in
the land of the Amorites, and they destroyed by their strength all
them of Esebon, and passing ouer Iordan they possessed all the hill
countrey.</ab>
<ab n="16">And they cast
forth before them, the Chanaanite, the Pheresite, the Iebusite, and
the Sychemite, and all the Gergesites, and they dwelt in that
countrey many dayes.<note> Iosh.12.8</note></ab>
<ab n="17">And whilest they
sinned not before their God, they prospered, because the God that
hateth iniquitie, was with them.</ab>
<ab n="18">But when they
departed from the way which he appointed them, they were destroyed
in many battels very sore, and were led captiues into a land that
was not theirs, and the Temple of their God was cast to the ground,
and their cities were taken by the enemies.<note> Iudg.2.11 and 3.8. , 2.Kings 25.1,11.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">But nowe are they
returned to their God, and are come vp from the places, where they
were scattered, and haue possessed Ierusalem, where their Sanctuary
is, and are seated in the hill countrey, for it was
desolate.<note> Ezra 1.1, 3. , Or, haue their dwellings.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">Now therefore, my
lord and gouernour, if there be any errour in this people, &amp;
they sinne against their God, let vs consider that this shal be
their ruine, and let vs goe vp, and we shal ouercome them.</ab>
<ab n="21">But if there be no
iniquitie in their nation, let my lord now passe by, lest their
Lord defend them, and their God be for them, and wee become a
reproch before all the world.</ab>
<ab n="22">And when Achior
had finished these sayings, all the people standing round about the
tent, murmured, and the chiefe men of Holofernes, and all that
dwelt by the Sea side, and in Moab, spake that he should kill
him.</ab>
<ab n="23">For, say they, we
will not be afraid of the face of the children of Israel, for loe,
it is a people that haue no strength, nor power for a strong
battell.<note> Gre. against a mighty armie.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">Now therefore,
Lord Holofernes, we will goe vp, and they shall be a pray, to be
deuoured of all thine armie.</ab>
