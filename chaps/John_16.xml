<head>CHAP.
XVI.</head>
<head>1 Christ comforteth his Disciples
against tribulation by the promise of the holy Ghost, and by his
Resurrection and Ascension: 23 Assureth their prayers made in his
Name to be acceptable to his Father. 33 Peace in Christ, and in the
world affliction.</head>

<ab n="1">These things
haue I spoken vnto you, that yee should not be offended.</ab>
<ab n="2">They shall put
you out of the Synagogues: yea, the time commeth, that whosoeuer
killeth you, will thinke that hee doeth God seruice.</ab>
<ab n="3">And these
things will they doe vnto you, because they haue not knowen the
Father, nor me.</ab>
<ab n="4">But these
things haue I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may
remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not vnto
you at the beginning, because I was with you.</ab>
<ab n="5">But now I goe
my way to him that sent mee, and none of you asketh me, Whither
goest thou?</ab>
<ab n="6">But because I
haue saide these things vnto you, sorow hath filled your
heart.</ab>
<ab n="7">Neuerthelesse;
I tell you the trueth, it is expedient for you that I goe away: for
if I goe not away, the Comforter will not come vnto you: but if I
depart, I will send him vnto you.</ab>
<ab n="8">And when he is
come, he will reproue the world of sinne, and of righteousnesse,
and of iudgement.<note> Or, conuince</note></ab>
<ab n="9">Of sinne,
because they beleeue not on me.</ab>
<ab n="10">Of righteousnesse,
because I goe to my Father, and ye see me no more.</ab>
<ab n="11">Of iudgement,
because the prince of this world is iudged.</ab>
<ab n="12">I haue yet many
things to say vnto you, but ye cannot beare them now:</ab>

<fw>Aske, and haue.</fw>
<ab n="13">Howbeit, when hee
the spirit of trueth is come, he wil guide you into all trueth: For
he shall not speake of himselfe: but whatsoeuer he shall heare,
that shall he speake, and he will shew you things to come.</ab>
<ab n="14">He shall glorifie
me, for he shall receiue of mine, and shall shew it vnto
you.</ab>
<ab n="15">All things that the
Father hath, are mine: therefore said I that he shall take of mine,
and shal shew it vnto you.</ab>
<ab n="16">A litle while, and
ye shall not see me: and againe a litle while, &amp; ye shall see
me: because I goe to the Father.</ab>
<ab n="17">Then saide some of
his disciples among themselues, What is this that he saith vnto vs,
A litle while, and ye shal not see me: and againe, a litle while,
and ye shall see me: and, because I goe to the Father?</ab>
<ab n="18">They said
therefore, What is this that he saith, A litle while? we cannot
tell what he saith.</ab>
<ab n="19">Now Iesus knew that
they were desirous to aske him, &amp; said vnto them, Doe ye
enquire among your selues of that I saide, A litle while, and ye
shall not see mee: and againe; A little while and ye shall see
me?</ab>
<ab n="20">Uerily, verily I
say vnto you, that ye shall weepe and lament, but the world shall
reioyce: And ye shall be sorrowfull, but your sorrow shall be
turned into ioy.</ab>
<ab n="21">A woman, when she
is in trauaile, hath sorrow, because her houre is come: but assoone
as she is deliuered of the child, she remembreth no more the
anguish, for ioy that a man is borne into the world.</ab>
<ab n="22">And ye now
therefore haue sorrow: but I will see you againe, and your heart
shall reioyce, and your ioy no man taketh from you.</ab>
<ab n="23">And in that day ye
shall aske me nothing: Uerily, verily I say vnto you, Whatsoeuer
yee shall aske the Father in my Name, he will giue it
you.<note> Mat.7.7.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">Hitherto haue ye
asked nothing in my Name: aske, and ye shall receiue, that your ioy
may be full.</ab>
<ab n="25">These things haue I
spoken vnto you in prouerbs: the time commeth when I shall no more
speake vnto you in prouerbes, but I shall shew you plainly of the
Father.<note> Or, parables. , Or, parables.</note></ab>

<fw>Peace in Christ.</fw>
<ab n="26">At that day ye
shall aske in my Name: and I say not vnto you that I will pray the
Father for you:</ab>
<ab n="27">For the Father
himselfe loueth you, because ye haue loued me and haue beleeued
that I came out from God.</ab>
<ab n="28">I came foorth from
the Father, and am come into the world: againe, I leaue the world,
and goe to the Father.</ab>
<ab n="29">His disciples said
vnto him, Loe, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no
prouerbe.<note> Or, parable.</note></ab>
<ab n="30">Now are we sure
that thou knowest al things, and needest not that any man should
aske thee: By this we beleeue that thou camest foorth from
God.</ab>
<ab n="31">Iesus answered
them, Doe yee now beleeue?</ab>
<ab n="32">Behold, the houre
commeth, yea is now come, that ye shall be scattered, euery man to
his owne, and shall leaue me alone: and yet I am not alone, because
the Father is with me.<note> Mat.26. 31. , Or, his owne home.</note></ab>
<ab n="33">These things I haue
spoken vnto you, that in me ye might haue peace, in the world ye
shall haue tribulation: but be of good cheare, I haue ouercome the
world.</ab>
