<head>CHAP.
XXXVII.</head>
<head>1 The Egyptians hauing raised the
siege of the Caldeans, king Zedekiah sendeth to Ieremiah to pray
for the people. 6 Ieremiah prophesieth the Caldeans certaine
returne and victory. 11 He is taken for a fugitiue, beaten and put
in prison. 16 He assureth Zedekiah of the captiuitie. 18 Intreating
for his liberty, he obtaineth some fauour.</head>

<ab n="1">And king
Zedekiah the sonne of Iosiah reigned in stead of Coniah the son of
Iehoiakim, whō Nebuchad-rezzar king of Babylon made king in
the land of Iudah.<note> Chap.22.24. 2.kings 24.17. and 2.chron. 36 10.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">But neither he,
nor his seruants, nor the people of the land, did hearken vnto the
words of the Lord, which he spake by the prophet
Ieremiah.<note> Heb. by the hand of the prophet.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And Zedekiah the
king sent Iehucal the sonne of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of
Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Ieremiah, saying, Pray now vnto
the Lord our God for vs.</ab>
<ab n="4">Nowe Ieremiah
came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him
into prison.</ab>
<ab n="5">Then Pharaohs
armie was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Caldeans that
besieged Ierusalem, heard tidings of them, they departed from
Ierusalem.</ab>

<fw>Ieremiah taken, and imprisoned.</fw>
<ab n="6">¶ Then came
the word of the Lord vnto the Prophet Ieremiah, saying,</ab>
<ab n="7">Thus saith the
Lord, the God of Israel, Thus shall ye say to the king of Iudah,
that sent you vnto me to enquire of me, Behold, Pharaohs armie
which is come forth to helpe you, shall returne to Egypt into their
owne land.</ab>
<ab n="8">And the Caldeans
shall come againe, and fight against this citie and take it, and
burne it with fire.</ab>
<ab n="9">Thus saith the
Lord, Deceiue not your selues, saying, The Caldeans shall surely
depart from vs: for they shall not depart.<note> Heb. soules</note></ab>
<ab n="10">For though yee
had smitten the whole armie of the Caldeans that fight against you,
and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise
vp euery man in his tent, and burne this citie with
fire.<note> Heb. thrust through.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">¶ And it
came to passe that when the armie of the Caldeans was broken vp
from Ierusalem for feare of Pharaohs armie,<note> Heb. made to ascend.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">Then Ieremiah
went forth out of Ierusalem to goe into the lande of Beniamin, to
separate himselfe thence in the mids of the people.<note> Or, to slip away from thence in the midst of the people.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">And when he was
in the gate of Beniamin, a captaine of the warde was there, whose
name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the sonne of Hananiah, &amp;
he tooke Ieremiah the Prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the
Caldeans</ab>
<ab n="14">Then said
Ieremiah, It is false, I fall not away to the Caldeans: but he
hearkened not to him: so Irijah tooke Ieremiah, and brought him to
the princes.<note> Heb. falsehood or lie.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">Wherfore the
princes were wroth with Ieremiah, and smote him, and put him in
prison, in the house of Ionathan the scribe, for they had made that
the prison.</ab>
<ab n="16">¶ When
Ieremiah was entred into the dungeon, and into the cabbins, and
Ieremiah had remained there many dayes:<note> Or, Celles.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">Then Zedekiah
the king sent and tooke him out, and the king asked him secretly in
his house, and said, Is there any word from the Lord ? and Ieremiah
said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be deliuered into the hand
of the king of Babylon.</ab>

<fw>Ieremiah taken, and imprisoned.</fw>
<ab n="18">Moreouer
Ieremiah sayd vnto king Zedekiah, What haue I offended against
thee, or against thy seruants, or against this people, that yee
haue put me in prison?</ab>
<ab n="19">Where are now
your prophets, which prophecied vnto you, saying, The king of
Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?</ab>
<ab n="20">Therefore heare
now, I pray thee, O my Lord the king; let my supplication, I pray
thee, be accepted before thee, that thou cause me not to returne to
the house of Ionathan the scribe, lest I die there.<note> Heb. let my supplication fall.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">Then Zedekiah
the king commanded that they should commit Ieremiah into the court
of the prison, and that they should giue him daily a piece of bread
out of the bakers streete, vntill all the bread in the citie were
spent. Thus Ieremiah remained in the court of the prison.</ab>
