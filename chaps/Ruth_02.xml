<head>CHAP. II.</head>
<head>1 Ruth gleaneth in the fields of
Boaz. 4 Boaz taking knowledge of her, 8 sheweth her great fauour.
18 That which she got, shee carieth to Naomi.</head>

<ab n="1">And Naomi had a
kinseman of her husbands, a mighty man of wealth, of the familie of
Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.</ab>
<ab n="2">And Ruth the
Moabitesse saide vnto Naomi, Let me now goe to the field, and
gleane eares of corne after him, in whose sight I shall finde
grace. And shee saide vnto her, Goe, my daughter.</ab>
<ab n="3">And she went,
and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her happe
was to light on a part of the fielde belonging vnto Boaz, who was
of the kinred of Elimelech.<note> Heb, happe happened. , Called Mat. 1.5. Booz.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">¶ And
behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said vnto the reapers, The
Lord bee with you; and they answered him, The Lord blesse
thee.</ab>
<ab n="5">Then said Boaz
vnto his seruant, that was set ouer the reapers, Whose damosell is
this?</ab>
<ab n="6">And the
seruaunt that was set ouer the reapers, answered and said, It is
the Moabitish damosell that came backe with Naomi out of the
countrey of Moab:</ab>
<ab n="7">And she said, I
pray you, let mee gleane and gather after the reapers amongst the
sheaues: so shee came, and hath continued euen from the morning
vntill now, that she taried a little in the house.</ab>
<ab n="8">Then said Boaz
vnto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Goe not to gleane in
another field, neither goe from hence, but abide here fast by my
maidens.</ab>
<ab n="9">Let thine eyes
be on the field that they doe reape, and go thou after them: Haue I
not charged the young men, that they shall not touch thee? and when
thou art athirst, goe vnto the vessels, and drinke of that which
the yong men haue drawen.</ab>

<fw>Boaz his kindnes toward Ruth.</fw>
<ab n="10">Then she fel
on her face, and bowed her selfe to the ground, and said vnto him,
Why haue I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take
knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?</ab>
<ab n="11">And Boaz
answered and said vnto her, It hath fully bene shewed me, all that
thou hast done vnto thy mother in law since the death of thine
husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the
land of thy natiuitie, and art come vnto a people, which thou
knewest not heretofore.</ab>
<ab n="12">The Lord
recompense thy worke, and a full reward be giuen thee of the Lord
God of Israel, vnder whose wings thou art come to trust.</ab>
<ab n="13">Then she said,
Let me finde fauour in thy sight, my lord, for that thou hast
comforted mee, and for that thou hast spoken friendly vnto thine
handmaid, though I be not like vnto one of thy
hand-maidens.<note> Or, I finde fauour. , Heb. to the heart.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And Boaz sayde
vnto her, At meale time come thou hither, and eate of the bread,
and dip thy morsell in the vineger. And shee sate beside the
reapers: and he reached her parched corne, and she did eate, and
was sufficed, and left.</ab>
<ab n="15">And when shee
was risen vp to gleane, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let
her gleane euen among the sheaues, &amp; reproch her
not.<note> Heb. shame her not.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">And let fall
also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leaue them that
she may gleane them, and rebuke her not.</ab>
<ab n="17">So she gleaned
in the field vntill euen, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it
was about an Ephah of barley.</ab>
<ab n="18">¶ And
shee tooke it vp, and went into the citie: and her mother in lawe
saw what shee had gleaned; and shee brought foorth, and gaue to her
that she had reserued, after she was sufficed.</ab>
<ab n="19">And her mother
in law said vnto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where
wroughtest thou? blessed be hee that did take knowledge of thee.
And shee shewed her mother in lawe with whom shee had wrought, and
said, The mans name with whom I wrought to day, is Boaz.</ab>
<ab n="20">And Naomi said
vnto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the Lord, who hath not
left off his kindnesse to the liuing and to the dead. And Naomi
said vnto her, The man is neere of kin vnto vs, one of our next
kinsemen.<note> Or, one that hath right to redeeme.</note></ab>

<fw>Boaz his kindnes toward Ruth.</fw>
<ab n="21">And Ruth the
Moabitesse said, He said vnto me also, Thou shalt keepe fast by my
yong men, vntill they haue ended all my haruest.</ab>
<ab n="22">And Naomi said
vnto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou
goe out with his maidens, that they meete thee not in any other
field.<note> Or, fall vpon thee.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">So shee kept
fast by the maidens of Boaz to gleane, vnto the end of barley
haruest, and of wheat haruest, and dwelt with her mother in
law.</ab>
