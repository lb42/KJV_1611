<head>CHAP.
CII.</head>
<head>1 The Prophet in his prayer maketh a
grieuous complaint. 12 He taketh comfort in the eternitie and
mercie of God. 18 The mercies of God are to be recorded. 23 He
sustaineth his weakenesse by the vnchangeablenes of
God.</head>

<ab n="1">[A prayer of the
afflicted when he is ouerwhelmed, and powreth out his complaint
before the Lord.] Heare my prayer, O Lord: and let my crie come
vnto thee.</ab>
<ab n="2">Hide not thy face
from me in the day when I am in trouble, incline thine eare vnto
me: in the day when I call, answere mee speedily.</ab>
<ab n="3">For my dayes are
consumed like smoke: and my bones are burnt as an
hearth.<note> Or, (as some reade) into smoke.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">My heart is
smitten, and withered like grasse: so that I forget to eate my
bread.</ab>
<ab n="5">By reason of the
voice of my groning, my bones cleaue to my skinne.<note> Or, flesh.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">I am like a
Pelican of the wildernes: I am like an owle of the desert.</ab>
<ab n="7">I watch, and am
as a sparowe alone vpon the house top.</ab>
<ab n="8">Mine enemies
reproch me all the day: and they that are mad against me, are
sworne against me.</ab>
<ab n="9">For I haue eaten
ashes like bread: and mingled my drinke with weeping.</ab>
<ab n="10">Because of thine
indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me vp, and cast me
downe.</ab>

<fw>A prayer of the afflicted.</fw>
<ab n="11">My dayes are
like a shadow, that declineth: &amp; I am withered like

<ab n="12">But thou, O
Lord, shalt endure for euer: and thy remembrance vnto all
generations.</ab>
<ab n="13">Thou shalt
arise, and haue mercie vpon Zion: for the time to fauour her, yea
the set time is come.</ab>
<ab n="14">For thy seruants
take pleasure in her stones: and fauour the dust therof.</ab>
<ab n="15">So the heathen
shall feare the Name of the Lord: and all the kings of the earth
thy glory.</ab>
<ab n="16">When the Lord
shall build vp Zion: he shall appeare in his glory.</ab>
<ab n="17">He will regard
the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.</ab>
<ab n="18">This shall be
written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be
created, shall praise the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="19">For hee hath
looked downe from the height of his Sanctuarie: from heauen did the
Lord beholde the earth:</ab>
<ab n="20">To heare the
groning of the prisoner: to loose those that are appointed to
death:<note> Heb. the children of death.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">To declare the
Name of the Lord in Zion: and his praise in Ierusalem:</ab>
<ab n="22">When the people
are gathered together: and the kingdomes to serue the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="23">He weakened my
strength in the way: he shortened my dayes.<note> Heb. afflicted.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">I said, O my
God, take me not away in the midst of my dayes: thy yeres are
throughout all generations.</ab>
<ab n="25">Of old hast thou
laid the foundation of the earth: and the heauens are the worke of
thy hands.<note> Heb.1.10</note></ab>
<ab n="26">They shall
perish, but thou shalt indure, yea all of them shall waxe old like
a garment: as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shalbe
changed.<note> Heb. stand</note></ab>
<ab n="27">But thou art the
same: and thy yeeres shall haue no end.</ab>
<ab n="28">The children of
thy seruants shal continue: and their seed shall be established
before thee.</ab>
