<head>CHAP.
III.</head>
<head>Hee declareth the singular loue of
God towards vs, in making vs his sonnes: 3 Who therefore ought
obediently to keepe his commaundements, 11 As also brotherly to
loue one another.</head>

<ab n="1">Beholde, what
manner of loue the Father hath bestowed vpon vs, that wee should be
called the sonnes of God: therfore the world knoweth vs not,
because it knewe him not.</ab>
<ab n="2">Beloued, now
are we the sonnes of God, and it doeth not yet appeare, what wee
shall be: but wee know, that when he shall appeare, we shall bee
like him: for we shall see him as he is.</ab>
<ab n="3">And euery man
that hath this hope in him, purifieth himselfe, euen as he is
pure.</ab>
<ab n="4">Whosoeuer
committeth sinne, transgresseth also the lawe: for sinne is the
transgression of the law.</ab>
<ab n="5">And ye know
that hee was manifested to take away our sinnes, and in him is no
sinne.</ab>
<ab n="6">Whosoeuer
abideth in him, sinneth not: whosoeuer sinneth, hath not seene him,
neither knowen him.</ab>

<fw>Of true loue.</fw>
<ab n="7">Little
children, let no man deceiue you: he that doth righteousnes, is
righteous, euen as he is righteous.</ab>
<ab n="8">He that
committeth sinne, is of the deuill, for the deuill sinneth from the
beginning: for this purpose the Sonne of God was manifested, that
he might destroy the works of the deuill.</ab>
<ab n="9">Whosoeuer is
borne of God, doth not commit sinne: for his seede remaineth in
him, and he cannot sinne, because he is borne of God.</ab>
<ab n="10">In this the
children of God are manifest, and the children of the deuill:
whosoeuer doeth not righteousnesse, is not of God, neither hee that
loueth not his brother.</ab>
<ab n="11">For this is the
message that yee heard from the beginning, that wee should loue one
another.<note> Or, commandement.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">Not as Cain, who
was of that wicked one, and slewe his brother: and wherefore slewe
hee him? because his owne workes were euill, and his brothers
righteous.</ab>
<ab n="13">Marueile not, my
brethren, if the world hate you.</ab>
<ab n="14">Wee know that wee
haue passed from death vnto life, because wee loue the brethren: he
that loueth not his brother, abideth in death.</ab>
<ab n="15">Whosoeuer hateth
his brother, is a murtherer, and yee knowe that no murtherer hath
eternall life abiding in him.</ab>
<ab n="16">Hereby perceiue
wee the loue of God, because he layd downe his life for vs, and wee
ought to lay downe our liues for the brethren.</ab>
<ab n="17">But who so hath
this worlds good, and seeth his brother hath need, and shutteth vp
his bowels of compassion from him; how dwelleth the loue of God in
him?</ab>
<ab n="18">My little
children, let vs not loue in word, neither in tongue, but indeede
and in trueth.</ab>
<ab n="19">And hereby wee
know that wee are of the trueth, and shall assure our hearts before
him.<note> Gr, perswade</note></ab>
<ab n="20">For if our heart
condemne vs, God is greater then our heart, and knoweth all
things.</ab>
<ab n="21">Beloued, if our
heart condemne vs not, then haue wee confidence towards
God.</ab>

<fw>Trie the spirits.</fw>
<ab n="22">And whatsoeuer we
aske, wee receiue of him, because we keepe his commandement, and
doe those things that are pleasing in his sight.</ab>
<ab n="23">And this is his
commandement, that we should beleeue on the Name of his Sonne Iesus
Christ, and loue one another, as hee gaue vs commandement.</ab>
<ab n="24">And hee that
keepeth his commandements dwelleth in him, and hee in him: and
hereby wee know that hee abideth in vs, by the spirit which hee
hath giuen vs.</ab>
