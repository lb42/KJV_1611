Amalek is ouercome by the holding vp of Moses hands. 15 Moses

<fw>Murmuring.</fw>
<ab n="1">And all the
Congregation of the children of Israel iourneyed from the
wildernesse of Sin after their iourneys, according to the
commandement of the Lord, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no
water for the people to drinke.</ab>
<ab n="2">Wherefore the
people did chide with Moses and said, Giue vs water that wee may
drinke. And Moses said vnto them, Why chide you with mee? Wherefore
doe ye tempt the Lord ?<note> Num. 20. 4.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And the people
thirsted there for water, and the people murmured against Moses,
and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought vs vp out of
Egypt, to kill vs and our children, and our cattell with
thirst?</ab>
<ab n="4">And Moses cried
vnto the Lord, saying, What shall I doe vnto this people? They be
almost ready to stone me.</ab>
<ab n="5">And the Lord said
vnto Moses, Goe on before the people, and take with thee of the
Elders of Israel: and thy rod wherewith thou smotest the riuer,
take in thine hand, and goe.<note> Chap. 7. 20.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">Behold, I will
stand before thee there, vpon the rocke in Horeb, and thou shalt
smite the rocke, and there shall come water out of it, that the
people may drinke. And Moses did so, in the sight of the Elders of
Israel.<note> Num. 20. 9. psal. 78. 15. and 105 41. wis. 11. 4. 1. cor. 10. 4.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">And hee called the
name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of
the children of Israel, and because they tempted the Lord, saying,
Is the Lord amongst vs, or not?<note> That is, Tentation. , That is, Chiding: or, strife.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Â¶ Then came
Amalek, &amp; fought with Israel in Rephidim.<note> Deut. 25. 17. wis. 11. 3.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And Moses said
vnto Ioshua, Choose vs out men, and goe out, fight with Amalek: to
morrow I will stand on the top of the hill, with the rodde of God
in mine hand.<note> Called Iesus, Acts. 7. 45.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">So Ioshua did as
Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron,
and Hur went vp to the top of the hill.</ab>
<ab n="11">And it came to
passe when Moses held vp his hand, that Israel preuailed: and when
he let downe his hand, Amalek preuailed.</ab>

<fw>Moses his sonnes.</fw>
<ab n="12">But Moses hands
were heauie, and they tooke a stone, and put it vnder him, and he
sate thereon: and Aaron and Hur stayed vp his hands, the one on the
one side, and the other on the other side, and his handes were
steady vntill the going downe of the Sunne.</ab>
<ab n="13">And Ioshua
discomfited Amalek, and his people, with the edge of the
sword.</ab>
<ab n="14">And the Lord said
vnto Moses, Write this for a memoriall in a booke, and rehearse it
in the eares of Ioshua: for I will vtterly put out the remembrance
of Amalek from vnder heauen.<note> Num. 24. 20. 1. sam, 15.3.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">And Moses built
an Altar, and called the name of it IEHOUAH Nissi.<note> That is, The Lord my banner.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">For he said,
Because the Lord hath sworne that the Lord will haue warre with
Amalek from generation to generation.<note> Or, because the hand of Amalek is against the throne of the LORD, therfore &amp;c. Hebr. The hand vpon the throne of the Lord.</note></ab>
