<ab n="1">Nowe it came to
passe in the dayes when þe Iudges ruled, that there
was a famine in the land: and a certaine man of Bethlehem Iudah,
went to soiourne in the countrey of Moab, he, and his wife, and his
two sonnes.<note> Hebr. iudged.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And the name of
the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife, Naomi, and the
name of his two sonnes, Mahlon, and Chilion, Ephrathites of
Bethlehem Iudah: and they came into the countrey of Moab, and
continued there.<note> Hebr. were.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And Elimelech
Naomies husband died, and shee was left, and her two
sonnes;</ab>
<ab n="4">And they tooke
them wiues of the women of Moab: the name of the one was Orpah, and
the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten
yeeres.</ab>
<ab n="5">And Mahlon and
Chilion died also both of them, and the woman was left of her two
sonnes, and her husband.</ab>
<ab n="6">¶ Then
shee arose with her daughters in law, that shee might returne from
the countrey of Moab: for shee had heard in the countrey of Moab,
how that the Lord had visited his people, in giuing them
bread.</ab>
<ab n="7">Wherefore she
went foorth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters
in law with her: and they went on the way to returne vnto the land
of Iudah.</ab>
<ab n="8">Aud Naomi said
vnto her two daughters in law, Goe, returne each to her mothers
house: the Lord deale kindly with you, as ye haue dealt with the
dead, and with me.</ab>

<fw>Ruth continueth with Naomi.</fw>
<ab n="9">The Lord graunt
you, that you may finde rest each of you in the house of her
husband. Then she kissed them, and they lift vp their voyce and
wept.</ab>
<ab n="10">And they said
vnto her, Surely wee will returne with thee, vnto thy
people.</ab>
<ab n="11">And Naomi
said, Turne againe, my daughters: why will you goe with mee? Are
there yet any moe sonnes in my wombe, that they may be your
husbands?</ab>
<ab n="12">Turne againe,
my daughters, go your way, for I am too old to haue an husband: if
I should say, I haue hope, if I should haue a husband also to
night, and should also beare sonnes:<note> Or, if I were with an husband.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Would ye tary
for them till they were growen? would ye stay for them from hauing
husbands? nay my daughters: for it grieueth me much for your sakes,
that the hand of the Lord is gone out against me.<note> Heb. hope. , Hebr. I haue much bitternes.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And they lift
vp their voyce, and wept againe: and Orpah kissed her mother in
law, but Ruth claue vnto her.</ab>
<ab n="15">And she said,
Behold, thy sister in law is gone backe vnto her people, and vnto
her gods: returne thou after thy sister in law.</ab>
<ab n="16">And Ruth said,
Intreate mee not to leaue thee, or to returne from following after
thee: for whither thou goest, I will goe; and where thou lodgest, I
will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my
God:<note> Or, be not against me.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">Where thou
diest, wil I die, and there will I bee buried: the Lord doe so to
me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.</ab>
<ab n="18">When shee sawe
that shee was stedfastly minded to goe with her, then shee left
speaking vnto her.<note> Hebr. strengthened her selfe.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">¶ So they
two went vntill they came to Bethlehem: And it came to passe when
they were come to Bethlehem, that all the citie was mooued about
them, and they said, Is this Naomi?</ab>
<ab n="20">And she said
vnto them, Call me not Naomi; call mee Mara: for the Almightie hath
dealt very bitterly with me.<note> That is, pleasant. , That is, bitter.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">I went out
full, and the Lord hath bought me home againe emptie: Why then call
ye me Naomi, seeing the Lord hath testified against me, and the
Almighty hath afflicted me?</ab>

<fw>Ruth continueth with Naomi.</fw>
<ab n="22">So Naomi
returned, and Ruth the Moabitesse her daughter in law with her,
which returned out of the countrey of Moab: and they came to
Bethlehem, in the beginning of barley haruest.</ab>
