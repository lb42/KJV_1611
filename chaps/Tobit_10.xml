<ab n="1">Nowe Tobit
his father counted euery day, and when the dayes of the iourney
were expired, and they came not:</ab>
<ab n="2">Then Tobit
said, Are they detained? or is Gabael dead? and there is no man to
giue him the money?</ab>
<ab n="3">Therefore he
was very sory.</ab>
<ab n="4">Then his wife
said to him, My sonne is dead, seeing hee stayeth long, and she
beganne to bewaile him, and said,</ab>
<ab n="5">Now I care
for nothing, my sonne, since I haue let thee goe, the light of mine
eyes.</ab>
<ab n="6">To whom Tobit
said, Hold thy peace, take no care; for he is safe.</ab>
<ab n="7">But she said,
Hold thy peace, and deceiue me not: my sonne is dead, and she went
out euery day into the way which they went, and did eate no meat on
the day time, and ceased not whole nights, to bewaile her sonne
Tobias, vntill the foureteene dayes of the wedding were expired,
which Raguel had sworne, that he should spend there: Then Tobias
said to Raguel, Let me goe, for my father, and my mother look no
more to see me.</ab>
<ab n="8">But his
father in law said vnto him, Tary with me, and I will send to thy
father, and they shall declare vnto him, how things goe with
thee.</ab>
<ab n="9">But Tobias
said, No: but let me goe to my father.</ab>
<ab n="10">Then Raguel arose
and gaue him Sara his wife, and halfe his goods, seruants, &amp;
cattell, and money.</ab>
<ab n="11">And hee blessed
them, and sent them away, saying, The God of heauen giue you a
prosperous iourney, my children.</ab>
<ab n="12">And he said to his
daughter, Honour thy father and thy mother in law, which are now
thy parents, that I may heare good report of thee: and hee kissed
her. Edna also said to Tobias, The Lord of heauen restore thee, my
deare brother, and grant that I may see thy children of my daughter
Sara before I die, that I may reioyce before the Lord: behold, I
commit my daughter vnto thee of speciall trust, wherefore doe not
entreate her euill.<note> Or, to be safely kept.</note></ab>
