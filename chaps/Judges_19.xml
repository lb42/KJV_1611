<head>CHAP.
XIX.</head>
<head>1 A Leuite goeth to Bethlehem to
fetch home his wife. 16 An old man entertaineth him at Gibeah. 22
The Gibeonites abuse his concubine to death. 29 He diuideth her
into twelue pieces to send them to the twelue tribes.</head>

<ab n="1">And it came to
passe in those dayes, when there was no King in Israel, that there
was a certaine Leuite soiourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who
tooke to him a concubine out of Bethlehem Iudah.<note> Chap. 17. 6.and 18.1. and 21.25. , Heb. a woman a concubine, or a wife a concubine.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And his concubine
played the whore against him, and went away from him vnto her
fathers house to Bethlehem Iudah, and was there foure whole
moneths.<note> Or, a yeere and foure moneths. Heb. dayes, foure moneths.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And her husband
arose, and went after her to speake friendly vnto her, and to bring
her againe, hauing his seruant with him, and a couple of asses: and
shee brought him into her fathers house, and when the father of the
damsell saw him, he reioyced to meet him.<note> Heb. to her heart.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">And his father in
law, the damosels father, reteined him, and hee abode with him
three dayes: so they did eate and drinke, and lodged there.</ab>
<ab n="5">¶ And it came
to passe on the fourth day, when they arose earely in the morning,
that he rose vp to depart: and the damosels father saide vnto his
sonne in lawe, Comfort thine heart with a morsell of bread, and
afterward goe your way.<note> Heb. strengthen.</note></ab>

<fw>The Leuites wife is forced to
death.</fw>
<ab n="6">And they sate
downe, and did eat and drinke both of them together: for the
damosels father had saide vnto the man, Be content, I pray thee,
and tary all night, and let thine heart be merrie.</ab>
<ab n="7">And when the man
rose vp to depart, his father in law vrged him: therfore he lodged
there againe.</ab>
<ab n="8">And hee arose
early in the morning on the fift day to depart, and the damosels
father sayd, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they taried
vntill after noone, and they did eate both of them.<note> Heb. till the day declined.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And when the man
rose vp to depart, hee and his concubine, and his seruant; his
father in law, the damsels father, said vnto him, Behold, now the
day draweth towardes euening, I pray you tarie all night: behold,
the day groweth to an ende, lodge heere, that thine heart may be
merrie; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest
goe home.<note> Hebr. is weake. , Heb. it is the pitching time of the day. , Heb. to thy tent.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">But the man would
not tary that night, but he rose vp and departed, and came ouer
against Iebus (which is Ierusalem:) and there were with him two
asses sadled, his concubine also was with him.<note> Heb. to ouer against Iebus.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And when they
were by Iebus, the day was farre spent, and the seruant said vnto
his master, Come, I pray thee, and let vs turne in into this citie
of the Iebusites, and lodge in it.</ab>
<ab n="12">And his master
said vnto him, We will not turne aside hither into the citie of a
stranger, that is not of the children of Israel, we will passe ouer
to Gibeah.</ab>
<ab n="13">And hee sayde
vnto his seruant, Come, and let vs draw neere to one of these
places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.</ab>
<ab n="14">And they passed
on and went their way, and the sunne went downe vpon them when they
were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Beniamin.</ab>
<ab n="15">And they turned
aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went
in, he sate him downe in a street of the citie: for there was no
man that tooke them into his house to lodging.</ab>
<ab n="16">¶ And
behold, there came an olde man from his worke out of the field at
euen, which was also of mount Ephraim; and hee soiourned in Gibeah,
but the men of the place were Beniamites.</ab>

<fw>The Leuites wife is forced to
death.</fw>
<ab n="17">And when he had
lift vp his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the streete of the
citie: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence commest
thou?</ab>
<ab n="18">And he said vnto
him, We are passing from Bethlehem Iudah, toward the side of mount
Ephraim, from thence am I: and I went to Bethlehem Iudah, but I am
now going to the house of the Lord, and there is no man that
receiueth me to house.<note> Hebr. gathereth.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">Yet there is both
straw and prouender for our asses, and there is bread and wine also
for me and for thy handmaid, and for the young man which is with
thy seruants: there is no want of any thing.</ab>
<ab n="20">And the olde man
said, Peace be with thee; howsoeuer, let all thy wants lie vpon me;
only lodge not in the street.</ab>
<ab n="21">So he brought him
into his house, and gaue prouender vnto the asses: and they washed
their feet, and did eate and drinke.</ab>
<ab n="22">¶ Now as
they were making their hearts merrie, behold, the men of the citie,
certaine sonnes of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at
the doore, and spake to the master of the house, the olde man,
saying; Bring foorth the man that came into thine house, that we
may know him.</ab>
<ab n="23">And the man, the
master of the house, went out vnto them, and said vnto them, Nay my
brethren, nay, I pray you doe not so wickedly; seeing that this man
is come into mine house, doe not this folly.<note> Genes. 19.6.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">Behold, here is
my daughter, a maiden, and his concubine, them I wil bring out now,
and humble yee them, and doe with them what seemeth good vnto you:
but vnto this man doe not so vile a thing.<note> Hebr. the matter of this folly.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">But the men would
not hearken to him: so the man tooke his concubine, and brought her
foorth vnto them, and they knew her, and abused her all the night
vntil the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her
goe.</ab>
<ab n="26">Then came the
woman in the dawning of the day, and fell downe at the doore of the
mans house, where her lord was, till it was light.</ab>
<ab n="27">And her lord rose
vp in the morning, &amp; opened the doores of the house, and went
out to goe his way: and behold, the woman his concubine was fallen
downe at the doore of the house, and her hands were vpon the
threshold.</ab>

<fw>The Leuites complaint.</fw>
<ab n="28">And he said vnto
her, Up, and let vs be going. But none answered: then the man tooke
her vp vpon an asse, and the man rose vp, and gate him vnto his
place.</ab>
<ab n="29">¶ And when
he was come into his house, hee tooke a knife, and layd hold on his
concubine, and diuided her, together with her bones, into twelue
pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.</ab>
<ab n="30">And it was so
that all that saw it, said, There was no such deed done nor seene,
from the day that the children of Israel came vp out of the land of
Egypt, vnto this day: consider of it, take aduise, and speake your
mindes.</ab>
