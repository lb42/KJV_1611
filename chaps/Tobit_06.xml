<head>CHAP. VI.</head>
<head>4 The Angel biddeth Tobias to take
the liuer, heart and gall out of a fish, 10 And to marry Sara the
daughter of Raguel; 16 And teacheth how to driue the wicked spirit
away.</head>

<ab n="1">And as they
went on their iourney, they came in the euening to the riuer
Tigris, &amp; they lodged there.</ab>
<ab n="2">And when the
yong man went downe to wash himselfe, a fish leaped out of the
riuer, and would haue deuoured him.</ab>
<ab n="3">Then the Angel
said vnto him, Take the fish; and the yong man layd hold of the
fish, and drew it to land.<note> Cast it vp on the land.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">To whom the
Angel said, Open the fish, and take the heart, and the liuer and
the gall, and put them vp safely.</ab>
<ab n="5">So the yong
man did as the Angel commaunded him, and when they had rosted the
fish, they did eate it: then they both went on their way, till they
drew neere to Ecbatane.</ab>
<ab n="6">Then the yong
man saide to the Angel; Brother Azarias, to what vse is the heart,
and the liuer, and the gall of the fish?</ab>
<ab n="7">And he said
vnto him, Touching the heart and the liuer, if a deuil, or an euil
spirit trouble any, we must make a smoke thereof before the man or
the woman, and the party shalbe no more vexed.</ab>
<ab n="8">As for the
gall it is good to anoint a man that hath whitenesse in his eyes,
and he shalbe healed.</ab>
<ab n="9">And when they
were come neere to Rages;</ab>
<ab n="10">The Angel said to
the yong man, Brother, to day wee shall lodge with Raguel, who is
thy cousin; hee also hath one onely daughter, named Sara, I wil
speake for her, that she may be giuen thee for a wife.</ab>
<ab n="11">For to thee doth
the right of her appertaine, seeing thou onely art of her
kinred.<note> Or, inheritance. , Num. 27. 8. &amp; 36.8.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">And the maide is
faire and wise, now therefore heare me, &amp; I wil speake to her
father, and when wee returne from Rages, we will celebrate the
mariage: for I know that Raguel cannot marry her to another
according to the Law of Moses, but he shalbe guiltie of death,
because the right of inheritance doeth rather appertaine to thee,
then to any other.</ab>
<ab n="13">Then the yong man
answered the Angel, I haue heard, brother Azarias, that this maide
hath beene giuen to seuen men, who all died in the marriage
chamber:</ab>
<ab n="14">And now I am the
onely sonne of my father, and I am afraid, lest if I goe in vnto
her, I die, as the other before; for a wicked spirit loueth her,
which hurteth no body, but those which come vnto her; wherefore I
also feare, lest I die, and bring my fathers and my mothers life
(because of me) to the graue with sorrow, for they haue no other
sonne to bury them.</ab>
<ab n="15">Then the Angel said
vnto him, Doest thou not remember the precepts, which thy father
gaue thee, that thou shouldest marrie a wife of thine owne kindred?
wherefore heare me, O my brother, for she shall be giuen thee to
wife, and make thou no reckoning of the euil spirit, for this same
night shall shee be giuen thee in mariage.</ab>
<ab n="16">And when thou shalt
come into the mariage chamber, thou shalt take the ashes of
perfume, and shalt lay vpon them, some of the heart, and liuer of
the fish, and shalt make a smoke with it.<note> Or, imbers.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">And the deuill
shall smell it, and flee away, and neuer come againe any more: but
when thou shalt come to her, rise vp both of you, and pray to God,
which is mercifull, who will haue pity on you, and saue you: feare
not, for shee is appointed vnto thee from the beginning; and thou
shalt preserue her, and shee shall goe with thee. Moreouer I
suppose that shee shall beare thee children. Now when Tobias had
heard these things, he loued her, and his heart was effectually
ioyned to her.<note> Or, vehemently.</note></ab>
