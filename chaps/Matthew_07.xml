<head>CHAP.
VII.</head>
<head>1 Christ ending his Sermon in the
Mount, reprooueth rash iudgement, 6 Forbiddeth to cast holy things
to dogges, 7 Exhorteth to prayer, 13 To enter in at the strait
gate, 15 To beware of false prophets, 21 Not to be hearers, but
doers of the word: 24 like houses builded on a rocke, 26 And not on
the sand.</head>


<fw>The strait gate.</fw>
<ab n="1">Iudge not, that ye
be not iudged.<note> Luk.6.37. rom.2.1.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">For with what
iudgment ye iudge, yee shall be iudged: and with what measure ye
mete, it shall be measured to you againe.<note> Mar.4.24. luke 6.38.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And why beholdest
thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye, but considerest not the
beame that is in thine owne eye?<note> Luk.6.41.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">Or how wilt thou
say to thy brother, Let mee pull out the mote out of thine eye, and
beholde, a beame is in thine owne eye?</ab>
<ab n="5">Thou hypocrite,
first cast out the beame out of thine owne eye: and then shalt thou
see clearely to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye.</ab>
<ab n="6">¶ Giue not
that which is holy vnto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearles
before swine: lest they trample them vnder their feete, and turne
againe and rent you.</ab>
<ab n="7">¶ Aske, and
it shalbe giuen you: seeke, and ye shall finde: knocke, and it
shalbe opened vnto you.<note> Chap.21.22. marke 11.24. luke 11.9. iohn 16.24. iam. 1.6.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">For euery one that
asketh, receiueth: and he that seeketh, findeth: and to him that
knocketh, it shalbe opened.</ab>
<ab n="9">Or what man is
there of you, whom if his sonne aske bread, will hee giue him a
stone?</ab>
<ab n="10">Or if he aske a
fish, will hee giue him a serpent?</ab>
<ab n="11">If ye then being
euill, know how to giue good giftes vnto your children, how much
more shall your Father which is in heauen, giue good things to them
that aske him?</ab>
<ab n="12">Therefore all
things whatsoeuer ye would that men should doe to you, doe ye euen
so to them: for this is the Law and the Prophets.<note> Luk.6.31.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">¶ Enter ye
in at the strait gate, for wide is the gate, and broad is the way
that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which goe in
thereat:<note> Luk.13.24.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">Because strait is
the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth vnto life, and few
there be that finde it.<note> Or, how.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">¶ Beware of
false prophets which come to you in sheepes clothing, but inwardly
they are rauening wolues.</ab>
<ab n="16">Yee shall knowe
them by their fruits: Doe men gather grapes of thornes, or figges
of thistles?<note> Luk.6.43.</note></ab>

<fw>False prophets.</fw>
<ab n="17">Euen so, euery
good tree bringeth forth good fruit: but a corrupt tree bringeth
forth euill fruit.</ab>
<ab n="18">A good tree
cannot bring forth euil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring
forth good fruit.</ab>
<ab n="19">Euery tree that
bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewen downe, and cast into the
fire.<note> Cha.3.10</note></ab>
<ab n="20">Wherefore by
their fruits ye shall know them.</ab>
<ab n="21">¶ Not euery
one that saith vnto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdome
of heauen: but he that doth the will of my father which is in
heauen.<note> Rom.2.13 iam.1.22.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">Many will say to
me in that day, Lord, Lord, haue we not prophecied in thy name? and
in thy name haue cast out deuils? and in thy name done many
wonderfull works?</ab>
<ab n="23">And then wil I
professe vnto them, I neuer knew you: Depart from me, ye that worke
iniquity.<note> Luk.13.27 , Psal.6.8.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">¶ Therefore,
whosoeuer heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I wil
liken him vnto a wise man, which built his house vpon a
rocke:<note> Luk.6.47.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">And the raine
descended, and the floods came, and the windes blew, and beat vpon
that house: and it fell not, for it was founded vpon a
rocke.</ab>
<ab n="26">And euery one
that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall bee
likened vnto a foolish man, which built his house vpon the
sand:</ab>
<ab n="27">And the raine
descended, and the floods came, and the windes blew, and beat vpon
that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.</ab>
<ab n="28">And it came to
passe, when Iesus had ended these sayings, the people were
astonished at his doctrine.<note> Mar.1.22 luke 4.32.</note></ab>
<ab n="29">For he taught
them as one hauing authoritie, and not as the Scribes.</ab>
