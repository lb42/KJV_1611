<head>CHAP.
III.</head>
<head>1 S. Paul testifieth his great loue
to the Thessalonians, partly by sending Timothie vnto them to
strengthen and comfort them: partly by reioycing in their weldoing:
10 and partly by praying for them, and desiring a safe comming vnto
them.</head>

<ab n="1">Wherefore
when wee could no longer forbeare, wee thought it good to bee left
at Athens alone:</ab>

<fw>Of afflictions.</fw>
<ab n="2">And sent
Timotheus our brother and minister of God, and our fellow labourer
in the Gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you
concerning your faith:</ab>
<ab n="3">That no
man should be mooued by these afflictions: for your selues know
that we are appointed therunto.</ab>
<ab n="4">For verily
when wee were with you, we told you before, that we should suffer
tribulation, euen as it came to passe and ye know.</ab>
<ab n="5">For this
cause when I could no longer forbeare, I sent to know your faith,
lest by some meanes the tempter haue tempted you, and our labor be
in vaine.</ab>
<ab n="6">But now
when Timotheus came from you vnto vs, and brought vs good tidings
of your faith and charitie, and that ye haue good remembrance of vs
alwayes, desiring greatly to see vs, as we also to see you:</ab>
<ab n="7">Therefore
brethren, wee were comforted ouer you in all our affliction and
distresse, by your faith:</ab>
<ab n="8">For now we
liue, if ye stand fast in the Lord.<note> Rom.7. 9.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">For what
thankes can we render to God againe for you, for all the ioy
wherewith wee ioy for your sakes before our God,</ab>
<ab n="10">Night
&amp; day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and
might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?</ab>
<ab n="11">Now God
himselfe and our Father, and our Lord Iesus Christ direct our way
vnto you.<note> Or, guide.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">And the
Lorde make you to increase, &amp; abound in loue one towards
another, and towards all men, euen as we doe towards you:</ab>
<ab n="13">To the
end hee may stablish your hearts vnblameable in holinesse before
God euen our Father, at the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ with
all his Saints.</ab>
