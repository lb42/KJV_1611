without Ierusalem in the fields of Kidron, and caried the ashes of
them vnto Bethel.</ab>
<ab n="5">And hee put downe

<fw>Iosiahs zeale, and reformation.</fw>
<ab n="12">And the altars
that were on the top of the vpper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings

altar, and the high place he brake downe, and burnt the high place,
and stampt it small to powder, and burnt the groue.</ab>
<ab n="16">And as Iosiah
turned himselfe, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the

burnt them vpon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word
of the Lord which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these
words.<note> 1. King 13.2.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">Then hee said,
What title is that that I see? and the men of the city told him, It
is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from Iudah, and
proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of
Bethel.</ab>
<ab n="18">And he said, Let
him alone: let no man moue his bones: so they let his bones alone,
with the bones of the Prophet that came out of Samaria.<note> Hebr. to escape.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">And all the
houses also of the hie places that were in the cities of Samaria,
which the kings of Israel had made to prouoke the Lord to anger,
Iosiah tooke away, and did to them according to all the actes that
hee had done in Bethel.</ab>
<ab n="20">And he slew all
the priests of the high places that were there, vpon the altars,
and burnt mens bones vpon them, and returned to
Ierusalem.<note> Or sacrificed.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">¶ And the
King commanded all the people saying, Keepe the Passeouer vnto the
Lord your God, as it is written in this booke of the
Couenant.<note> 2. Chron. 35.1. 1.esd. 1.1. , Exo. 12.3 deut. 16.2.</note></ab>

<fw>He is slaine.</fw>
<ab n="22">Surely there was
not holden such a Passeouer, from the daies of the Iudges that
iudged Israel, nor in all the dayes of the kings of Israel, nor of
the kings of Iudah:</ab>
<ab n="23">But in the
eighteenth yeere of king Iosiah, wherein this Passeouer was holden
to the Lord in Ierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="24">¶ Moreouer
the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images,
and the idoles, and all the abominations that were spied in the
land of Iudah, and in Ierusalem, did Iosiah put away, that he might
performe the wordes of the lawe, which were written in the booke
that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the Lord.<note> Or, Teraphim. , Leuit. 20.27. deut. 18.11.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">And like vnto
him was there no king before him, that turned to the Lord with all
his heart, and with all his soule, and with all his might,
according to all the Law of Moses, neither after him arose there
any like him.</ab>
<ab n="26">¶
Notwithstanding, the Lord turned not from the fiercenesse of his
great wrath, wherwith his anger was kindled against Iudah, because
of all the prouocations that Manasseh had prouoked him
withall.<note> Heb. angers.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">And the Lord
said, I will remoue Iudah also out of my sight, as I haue remoued
Israel, and will cast off this citie Ierusalem, which I haue
chosen, and the house of which I sayd, My name shall be
there.<note> 1.King.8.29. &amp; 9.3. Chap. 21.7.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">Now the rest of
the actes of Iosiah, and all that hee did, are they not written in
the booke of the chronicles of the kings of Iudah?</ab>
<ab n="29">¶ In his
dayes, Pharaoh Nechoh king of Egypt, went vp against the king of
Assyria to the riuer Euphrates: and king Iosiah went against him,
and hee slew him at Megiddo, when he had seene him.<note> 2. Chron. 35.20.</note></ab>
<ab n="30">And his seruants
caried him in a charet dead from Megiddo, &amp; brought him to
Ierusalem, and buried him in his owne sepulchre: and the people of
the land tooke Iehoahaz the sonne of Iosiah, and anointed him, and
made him king in his fathers stead.<note> 2. Chron. 36.1.</note></ab>
<ab n="31">¶ Iehoahaz
was twenty and three yeeres olde when he beganne to reigne, and hee
reigned three moneths in Ierusalem: and his mothers name was
Hamital, the daughter of Ieremiah, of Libnah.</ab>

<fw>Iehoiakim king.</fw>
<ab n="32">And hee did that
which was euill in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his
fathers had done.</ab>
<ab n="33">And Pharaoh

might not reigne in Ierusalem, and put the land to a tribute of an
hundred talents of siluer, and a talent of golde.<note> Or, because he reigned. , Heb. set a mulct vpon the land.</note></ab>
<ab n="34">And Pharaoh
Nechoh made Eliakim the sonne of Iosiah king, in the roume of
Iosiah his father, and turned his name to Iehoiakim, and tooke
Iehoahaz away: and hee came to Egypt, and died there.<note> Matth. 1.12. called Iakim.</note></ab>
<ab n="35">And Iehoiakim
gaue the siluer, and the golde to Pharaoh, but he taxed the land to
giue the money according to the commandement of Pharaoh: hee
exacted the siluer and the golde of the people of the land, of
euery one according to his taxation, to giue it vnto Pharaoh
Nechoh.</ab>
<ab n="36">¶ Iehoiakim

<ab n="37">And he did that
which was euill in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his
fathers had done.</ab>
