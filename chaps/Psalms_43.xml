<head>CHAP.
XLIII.</head>
<head>1 Iacob is hardly perswaded to send
Beniamin. 15 Ioseph entertaineth his brethren. 31 Hee maketh them a
feast.</head>


<fw>Beniamin goeth with his
brethren.</fw>
<ab n="1">And the famine
was sore in the land.</ab>
<ab n="2">And it came to
passe when they had eaten vp the corne, which they had brought out
of Egypt, their father said vnto them, Goe againe, buy vs a little
foode.</ab>
<ab n="3">And Iudah spake
vnto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest vnto vs, saying, Ye
shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.<note> Heb. protesting he protested. , Chap.42. 20.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">If thou wilt send
our brother with vs, we will goe downe and buy thee food.</ab>
<ab n="5">But if thou wilt
not send him, we will not goe downe: for the man saide vnto vs, Ye
shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.</ab>
<ab n="6">And Israel said,
Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye
had yet a brother?</ab>
<ab n="7">And they said,
The man asked vs straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying,
Is your father yet aliue? haue yee another brother? and we tolde
him according to the tenour of these words: Could we certainely
knowe that he would say, Bring your brother downe?<note> Heb. asking he asked vs. , Heb. mouth , Heb. knowing could we know?</note></ab>
<ab n="8">And Iudah said
vnto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and wee will arise
and go, that we may liue, and not die, both we, and thou, and also
our little ones.</ab>
<ab n="9">I will be surety
for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not vnto
thee, and set him before thee, then let me beare the blame for
euer.<note> Chap.44. 32.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">For except we
had lingred, surely now wee had returned this second
time.<note> Or, twice by this.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And their father
Israel said vnto them, If it must bee so now, doe this: take of the
best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carie downe the man a
Present, a litle balme, and a litle honie, spices, and myrrhe,
nuts, and almonds.</ab>
<ab n="12">And take double
money in your hand, and the money that was brought againe in the
mouth of your sackes: carie it againe in your hand, peraduenture it
was an ouersight.</ab>
<ab n="13">Take also your
brother, and arise, goe againe vnto the man.</ab>

<fw>Beniamin goeth with his
brethren.</fw>
<ab n="14">And God
Almightie giue you mercie before the man, that he may send away
your other brother, and Beniamin: If I be bereaued of my children,
I am bereaued.<note> Or, and I, as I haue bene &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">¶ And the
men tooke that Present, and they tooke double money in their hand,
and Beniamin, and rose vp, and went downe to Egypt, and stood
before Ioseph.</ab>
<ab n="16">And when Ioseph
sawe Beniamin with them, hee said to the ruler of his house, Bring
these men home, and slay, and make ready: for these men shall dine
with me at noone.<note> Heb. kill a killing. , Hebr. eate.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">And the man did
as Ioseph hade: and the man brought the men into Iosephs
house.</ab>
<ab n="18">And the men were
afraid, because they were brought into Iosephs house, and they
said, Because of the money that was returned in our sackes at the
first time are we brought in, that hee may seeke occasion against
vs, and fall vpon vs, and take vs for bondmen, and our
asses.<note> Heb. roll himselfe vpon vs.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">And they came
neere to the steward of Iosephs house, and they communed with him
at the doore of the house,</ab>
<ab n="20">And said, O Sir,
we came indeed downe at the first time to buy food.<note> Cha.42.3 , Heb. comming downe we came downe.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">And it came to
passe when wee came to the Inne, that wee opened our sackes, and
behold, euery mans money was in the mouth of his sacke, our money
in ful weight: and we haue brought it againe in our hand.</ab>
<ab n="22">And other money
haue wee brought downe in our handes to buy food: we cannot tell
who put our money in our sackes.</ab>
<ab n="23">And he said,
Peace be to you, feare not: your God, and the God of your father,
hath giuen you treasure in your sackes: I had your money. And hee
brought Simeon out vnto them.<note> Heb. your money came to mee.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">And the man
brought the men into Iosephs house, and gaue them water, and they
washed their feete, and he gaue their asses prouender.<note> Chap.18. 4. &amp; 24.32.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">And they made
ready the Present against Ioseph came at noone: for they heard that
they should eate bread there.</ab>
<ab n="26">¶ And when
Ioseph came home, they brought him the Present which was in their
hand, into the house, and bowed themselues to him to the
earth.</ab>
<ab n="27">And he asked
them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man
of whom ye spake? Is he yet aliue?<note> Heb. peace. , Hebr. Is there peace to your father?</note></ab>

<fw>A cup put in Beniamins sacke.</fw>
<ab n="28">And they
answered, Thy seruant our father is in good health, hee is yet
aliue: &amp; they bowed downe their heads, and made
obeisance.</ab>
<ab n="29">And he lift vp
his eyes, and sawe his brother Beniamin, his mothers sonne, and
said, Is this your yonger brother, of whom yee spake vnto mee? and
he said, God be gracious vnto thee, my sonne.</ab>
<ab n="30">And Ioseph made
haste: for his bowels did yerne vpon his brother: and he sought
where to weepe, and hee entred into his chamber, &amp; wept
there.</ab>
<ab n="31">And he washed
his face, and went out, and refrained himselfe, and saide, Set on
bread.</ab>
<ab n="32">And they set on
for him by himselfe, and for them by themselues, and for the
Egyptians which did eate with him, by themselues: because the
Egyptians might not eate bread with the Hebrewes: for that is an
abomination vnto the Egyptians.</ab>
<ab n="33">And they sate
before him, the first borne according to his birthright, and the
yongest according to his youth: and the men marueiled one at
another.</ab>
<ab n="34">And hee tooke
and sent measses vnto them from before him: but Beniamins measse
was fiue times so much as any of theirs: and they drunke, and were
merry with him.<note> Heb. they dranke largely.</note></ab>
