<ab n="2">I wil also

Iehoshaphat, and wil plead with them there for my people, and for
my heritage Israel, whom they haue scattered among the nations, and
parted my land.</ab>
<ab n="3">And they haue
cast lots for my people, and haue giuen a boy for a harlot, and
solde a girle for wine, that they might drinke.</ab>
<ab n="4">Yea and what
haue ye to do with me, O Tyre and Zidon, and all the coasts of
Palestine? will ye render mee a recompence? and if ye recompense
me, swiftly and speedily will I returne your recompense vpon your
owne head.</ab>

haue taken my siluer and my gold, and haue caried into your temples
my goodly pleasant things.<note> Heb. desireable.</note></ab>

also of Iudah and the children of Ierusalem haue ye sold vnto the

raise them out of the place whither yee haue sold them, and wil
returne your recompence vpon your owne head.</ab>

your sonnes and your daughters into the hande of the children of
Iudah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people farre
off, for the Lord hath spoken it.</ab>

vp.<note> Heb. sanctifie.</note></ab>

<ab n="12">Let the
heathen be wakened, and come vp to the valley of Iehoshaphat: for
there will I sit to iudge all the heathen round about.</ab>

great.<note> Reue.14. 15.</note></ab>

forth of the house of the Lord, and shall water the valley of
Shittim.<note> Amos 9. 13. , Hebr goe.</note></ab>

shall dwell for euer, and Ierusalem from generation to
generation.<note> Or, abide.</note></ab>
