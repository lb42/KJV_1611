<head>1 Baruch being dismayed, 4 Ieremiah
instructeth and comforteth him.</head>

<ab n="1">The word that
Ieremiah the Prophet spake vnto Baruch the sonne of Neriah, when he
had written these words in a booke at the mouth of Ieremiah, in the
fourth yeere of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king of Iudah,
saying,</ab>
<ab n="2">Thus saith the
Lord the God of Israel vnto thee, O Baruch,</ab>
<ab n="3">Thou didst say,
Woe is me now, for the Lord hath added griefe to my sorow, I
fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.</ab>
<ab n="4">Â¶ Thus
shalt thou say vnto him, The Lord saith thus, Behold, that which I
haue built will I breake downe, and that which I haue planted I
will plucke vp, euen this whole land:</ab>
<ab n="5">And seekest thou
great things for thy selfe? seeke them not: for behold, I wil bring
euill vpon all flesh, saith the Lord: but thy life will I giue vnto
thee for a pray in all places whither thou goest.<note> Chap.39. 18.</note></ab>
