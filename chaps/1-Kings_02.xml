<fw>Dauids charge</fw>
<ab n="1">Now the dayes of
Dauid drew nigh, that he should die, and he charged Solomon his
sonne, saying;</ab>
<ab n="2">I goe the way of
all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thy selfe a
man.</ab>
<ab n="3">And keepe the
charge of the Lord thy God, to walke in his wayes, to keepe his
Statutes, and his Commandements, &amp; his Iudgements, and his
Testimonies, as it is written in the Law of Moses, that thou mayest
prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoeuer thou turnest thy
selfe:<note> Deut. 29. 9. iosh.1.7. , Or, doe wisely.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">That the Lord may
continue his word which hee spake concerning me, saying, If thy
children take heede to their way, to walke before mee in trueth,
with all their heart, and with all their soule, there shall not
faile thee (sayd hee) a man on the throne of Israel.<note> 2. Sam. 7.12. , Heb. be cut off from thee from the throne.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">Moreouer thou
knowest also what Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah did to mee, and what he
did to the two captaines of the hostes of Israel, vnto Abner the
sonne of Ner, and vnto Amasa the sonne of Iether, whom hee slewe,
and shed the blood of warre in peace, and put the blood of warre
vpon his girdle that was about his loynes, and in his shooes that
were on his feet.<note> 2.Sam.3. 27. , 2.Sam. 20.10. , Heb. put.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">Doe therefore
according to thy wisedome, and let not his hoare head goe downe to
the graue in peace.</ab>
<ab n="7">But shewe
kindnesse vnto the sonnes of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them
be of those that eate at thy table: for so they came to me when I
fled because of Absalom thy brother.<note> 2.Sam. 19.31.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">And behold, thou
hast with thee Shimei the sonne of Gera, a Beniamite of Bahurim,
which cursed mee with a grieuous curse, in the day when I went to
Mahanaim: but hee came downe to meete me at Iordane, and I sware to
him by the Lord, saying, I will not put thee to death with the
sword.<note> 2.Sam. 16.5. , Heb. strong , 2.Sam. 19.23.</note></ab>

<fw>Adonijahs request.</fw>
<ab n="9">Nowe therefore
holde him not guiltlesse: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what
thou oughtest to doe vnto him, but his hoare head bring thou downe
to the graue with blood.</ab>
<ab n="10">So Dauid slept
with his fathers, and was buried in the citie of Dauid.<note> Act 2. 29.and 13. 36.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And the dayes
that Dauid raigned ouer Israel, were fourty yeeres: seuen yeeres
raigned hee in Hebron, and thirty and three yeeres raigned hee in
Ierusalem.<note> 2.Sam.5.4 1. chron.29 26,27.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">¶ Then sate
Solomon vpon the throne of Dauid his father, and his kingdome was
established greatly.<note> 2. Chron. 29.23.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">¶ And
Adoniiah the sonne of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of
Solomon, and she said, Commest thou peaceably? And he said,
Peaceably.</ab>
<ab n="14">He said moreouer,
I haue somewhat to say vnto thee. And she saide, Say on.</ab>
<ab n="15">And he said, Thou
knowest that the kingdome was mine, and that all Israel set their
faces on me, that I should raigne: howbeit the kingdome is turned
about, and is become my brothers: for it was his from the
Lord.</ab>
<ab n="16">And now I aske
one petition of thee, deny me not. And she saide vnto him, Say
on.<note> Heb. turne not away my face.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">And hee saide,
Speake, I pray thee, vnto Solomon the king (for hee will not say
thee nay) that he giue me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.</ab>
<ab n="18">And Bathsheba
said, Wel, I will speake for thee vnto the king.</ab>
<ab n="19">¶ Bathsheba
therefore went vnto king Solomon, to speake vnto him for Adoniiah:
and the king rose vp to meete her, and bowed himselfe vnto her, and
sate downe on his throne, and caused a seate to bee set for the
Kings mother, and she sate on his right hand.</ab>
<ab n="20">Then she said, I
desire one small petition of thee, I pray thee say me not nay: and
the King said vnto her, Aske on, my mother, for I will not say thee
nay.</ab>
<ab n="21">And she saide,
Let Abishag the Shunammite be giuen to Adoniiah thy brother to
wife.</ab>
<ab n="22">And king Solomon
answered, and said vnto his mother, And why doest thou aske Abishag
the Shunammite for Adoniiah? Aske for him the kingdome also (for he
is mine elder brother) euen for him, and for Abiathar the Priest,
&amp; for Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah.</ab>

<fw>Ioab slaine.</fw>
<ab n="23">Then king Solomon
sware by the Lord, saying, God doe so to me, and more also, if
Adoniiah haue not spoken this word against his owne life.</ab>
<ab n="24">Now therefore as
the Lord liueth, which hath established mee, and set mee on the
throne of Dauid my father, and who hath made me an house as he
promised, Adoniiah shall be put to death this day.<note> 2.Sam.7. 12,13.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">And king Solomon
sent by the hand of Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and he fell vpon
him that he died.</ab>
<ab n="26">¶ And vnto
Abiathar the Priest saide the King, Get thee to Anathoth, vnto
thine own fields, for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at
this time put thee to death, because thou barest the arke of the
Lord God before Dauid my father, and because thou hast bene
afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.<note> Heb. a man of death.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">So Solomon thrust
out Abiathar from beeing Priest vnto the Lord: that hee might
fulfill the word of the Lord, which hee spake concerning the house
of Eli in Shiloh.<note> 1.Sam.2. 31,35.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">¶ Then
tidings came to Ioab (for Ioab had turned after Adoniiah, though
hee turned not after Absalom) and Ioab fled vnto the Tabernacle of
the Lord, and caught hold on the hornes of the Altar.</ab>
<ab n="29">And it was told
king Solomon that Ioab was fled vnto the Tabernacle of the Lord,
and behold, hee is by the Altar: Then Solomon sent Benaiah the
sonne of Iehoiada, saying, Goe fall vpon him.</ab>
<ab n="30">And Benaiah came
to the Tabernacle of the Lord, and said vnto him, Thus saith the
king, Come foorth. And he said, Nay, but I will die heere. And
Benaiah brought the king word againe, saying, Thus said Ioab, and
thus he answered me.</ab>
<ab n="31">And the king
saide vnto him, Doe as he hath said, and fall vpon him, and bury
him, that thou mayest take away the innocent blood which Ioab shed,
from mee, and from the house of my father.</ab>

<fw>Ioab is slaine.</fw>
<ab n="32">And the Lord
shall returne his blood vpon his owne head, who fell vpon two men,
more righteous and better then hee, and slew them with the sword,
my father Dauid not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the sonne of
Ner, captaine of the hoste of Israel, and Amasa the sonne of
Iether, captaine of the hoste of Iudah.<note> 2.Sam. 3.27. , 2.Sam.20. 10.</note></ab>
<ab n="33">Their blood shall
therefore returne vpon the head of Ioab, and vpon the head of his
seed for euer: but vpon Dauid, and vpon his seede, and vpon his
house, and vpon his throne, shall there bee peace for euer from the
Lord.</ab>
<ab n="34">So Benaiah the
sonne of Iehoiada went vp, and fell vpon him, and slewe him, and
hee was buried in his owne house in the wildernesse.</ab>
<ab n="35">¶ And the
king put Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada in his roome ouer the hoste,
and Zadok the Priest did the king put in the roume of
Abiathar.</ab>
<ab n="36">¶ And the
king sent, and called for Shimei, and said vnto him, Build thee an
house in Ierusalem, and dwell there, and goe not forth thence any
whither.</ab>
<ab n="37">For it shall be,
that on the day thou goest out, &amp; passest ouer the brooke
Kidron, thou shalt know for certaine, that thou shalt surely die:
thy blood shal be vpon thine owne head.</ab>
<ab n="38">And Shimei said
vnto the King, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said,
so will thy seruant doe. And Shimei dwelt in Ierusalem many
dayes.</ab>
<ab n="39">And it came to
passe at the end of three yeeres, that two of the seruants of
Shimei ranne away vnto Achish sonne of Maachah king of Gath: and
they told Shimei, saying, Beholde, thy seruants be in Gath.</ab>
<ab n="40">And Shimei arose,
and sadled his asse, and went to Gath to Achish, to seeke his
seruants: and Shimei went and brought his seruants from
Gath.</ab>
<ab n="41">And it was told
Solomon, that Shimei had gone from Ierusalem to Gath, and was come
againe.</ab>
<ab n="42">And the king sent
and called for Shimei, and said vnto him, Did I not make thee to
sweare by the Lord, and protested vnto thee, saying, Know for a
certaine, that on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any
whither, that thou shalt surely die? And thou saidest vnto me, The
word that I haue heard, is good.</ab>
<ab n="43">Why then hast
thou not kept the Oath of the Lord, and the commandement that I
haue charged thee with?</ab>

<fw>Shimei is slaine.</fw>
<ab n="44">The king said
moreuer to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickednesse which thine
heart is priuie to, that thou diddest to Dauid my father: therefore
the Lord shall returne thy wickednesse vpon thine owne
head.</ab>
<ab n="45">And king Solomon
shall be blessed, and the throne of Dauid shall bee established
before the Lord for euer.</ab>
<ab n="46">So the king
commaunded Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, which went out, and fell
vpon him, that he died, and the kingdome was established in the
hand of Solomon.<note> 2.Chron. 1.1.</note></ab>
