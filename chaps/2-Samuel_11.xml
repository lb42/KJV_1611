<fw>Dauids adulterie, and murder.</fw>
<ab n="1">And it came to
passe, that after the yeere was expired, at the time when kings goe
foorth to battell, that Dauid sent Ioab and his seruants with him,
and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and
besieged Rabbah: but Dauid taried still at Ierusalem.<note> Heb. at the returne of the yeere. , 1. Chron. 20.1.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">¶ And it
came to passe in an euening tide, that Dauid arose from off his
bed, and walked vpon the roofe of the kings house: and from the
roofe he saw a woman washing her selfe; and the woman was very
beautifull to looke vpon.</ab>
<ab n="3">And Dauid sent
and enquired after the woman: and one said, Is not this Bath-sheba
the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?</ab>
<ab n="4">And Dauid sent
messengers, and tooke her, and shee came in vnto him, and he lay
with her, ( for she was purified from her vncleannesse) and shee
returned vnto her house.<note> Or, and wh she had purified her selfe, &amp;c. she returned. , Leuit. 15. 19. and 18. 19.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">And the woman
conceiued, and sent and tolde Dauid, and said, I am with
childe.</ab>
<ab n="6">¶ And Dauid
sent to Ioab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Ioab sent
Uriah to Dauid.</ab>
<ab n="7">And when Uriah
was come vnto him, Dauid demanded of him how Ioab did, and how the
people did, and how the warre prospered.<note> Heb. of the peace of &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">And Dauid said
to Uriah, Goe downe to thy house, and wash thy feete. And Uriah
departed out of the Kings house, and there followed him a messe of
meat from the king.<note> Heb. went out after him.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">But Uriah slept
at the doore of the kings house, with all the seruants of his lord,
and went not downe to his house.</ab>
<ab n="10">And when they
had tolde Dauid, saying, Uriah went not downe vnto his house, Dauid
said vnto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy iourney? why then diddest
thou not goe downe vnto thine house?</ab>
<ab n="11">And Uriah said
vnto Dauid, The Arke, and Israel, and Iudah abide in tents, and my
lord Ioab, and the seruants of my lord are encamped in the open
fields; shall I then goe into mine house, to eate and to drinke,
and to lie with my wife? As thou liuest, and as thy soule liueth, I
will not doe this thing.</ab>
<ab n="12">And Dauid said
to Uriah, Tary here to day also, and to morow I will let thee
depart. So Uriah abode in Ierusalem that day, and the
morrow.</ab>

<fw>Dauids adulterie, and murder.</fw>
<ab n="13">And when Dauid
had called him, hee did eate and drinke before him, and he made him
drunke: and at euen hee went out to lie on his bed with the
seruants of his lord, but went not downe to his house.</ab>
<ab n="14">¶ And it
came to passe in the morning, that Dauid wrote a letter to Ioab,
and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</ab>
<ab n="15">And he wrote in
the letter, saying, Set yee Uriah in the forefront of the hottest
battel, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and
die.<note> Heb. strong , Heb. from after him.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">And it came to
passe when Ioab obserued the citie, that he assigned Uriah vnto a
place where hee knewe that valiant men were.</ab>
<ab n="17">And the men of
the city went out, and fought with Ioab: and there fell some of the
people of the seruants of Dauid, and Uriah the Hittite died
also.</ab>
<ab n="18">¶ Then
Ioab sent, and tolde Dauid all the things concerning the
warre:</ab>
<ab n="19">And charged the
messenger, saying, When thou hast made an ende of telling the
matters of the warre vnto the King;</ab>
<ab n="20">And if so be
that the kings wrath arise, and hee say vnto thee, Wherefore
approched ye so nigh vnto the city when yee did fight? Knew yee not
that they would shoot from the wall?</ab>
<ab n="21">Who smote
Abimelech the sonne of Ierubesheth? Did not a woman cast a piece of
a milstone vpon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went
ye nigh the wall? Then say thou, Thy seruant Uriah the Hittite is
dead also.<note> Iudg. 9. 53.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">¶ So the
messenger went, and came and shewed Dauid all that Ioab had sent
him for.</ab>
<ab n="23">And the
messenger said vnto Dauid, Surely the men preuailed against vs, and
came out vnto vs into the field, and we were vpon them euen vnto
the entring of the gate.</ab>
<ab n="24">And the
shooters shot from off the wall vpon thy seruants, and some of the
Kings seruants be dead, and thy seruant Uriah the Hittite is dead
also.</ab>
<ab n="25">Then Dauid said
vnto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say vnto Ioab, Let not this
thing displease thee: for the sword deuoureth one as well as
another: Make thy battell more strong against the citie, and
ouerthrow it; and encourage thou him.<note> Heb. be euill in thine eyes. , Heb. so and such.</note></ab>

<fw>Nathans parable</fw>
<ab n="26">¶ And when
the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she
mourned for her husband.</ab>
<ab n="27">And when the
mourning was past, Dauid sent, and fet her to his house, and she
became his wife, and bare him a sonne: but the thing that Dauid had
done, displeased the Lord.<note> Heb. was euill in the eies of.</note></ab>
