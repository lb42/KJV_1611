<head>CHAP. X.</head>
<head>1 The Israelites assembled at
Shechem to crowne Rehoboam, by Ieroboam make a suite of relaxation
vnto him. 6 Rehoboam, refusing the old mens counsell, by the aduice
of yong men, answereth them roughly. 16 Tenne Tribes reuolting,
kill Hadoram, and make Rehoboam to flie.</head>

<ab n="1">And Rehoboam
went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him
king.<note> 1.King.12 1,&amp;c.</note></ab>

<fw>Rehoboams yoke.</fw>
<ab n="2">And it came
to passe when Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat (who was in Egypt,
whither hee had fled from the presence of Solomon the king) heard
it, that Ieroboam returned out of Egypt.</ab>
<ab n="3">And they
sent and called him. So Ieroboam and all Israel came, and spake to
Rehoboam, saying,</ab>
<ab n="4">Thy father
made our yoke grieuous, nowe therefore ease thou somewhat the
grieuous seruitude of thy father, and his heauy yoke that he put
vpon vs, and we will serue thee.</ab>
<ab n="5">And hee said
vnto them, Come againe vnto me after three dayes. And the people
departed.</ab>
<ab n="6">¶ And
king Rehoboam tooke counsel with the old men that had stood before
Solomon his father, while hee yet liued, saying, What counsell giue
ye me, to returne answere to this people?</ab>
<ab n="7">And they
spake vnto him, saying, If thou bee kinde to this people, and
please them, and speake good words to them, they will be thy
seruants for euer.</ab>
<ab n="8">But he
forsooke the counsel which the old men gaue him, and tooke counsell
with the yong men, that were brought vp with him, that stood before
him.</ab>
<ab n="9">And he said
vnto them, What aduice giue ye, that wee may returne answere to
this people, which haue spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the
yoke that thy father did put vpon vs?</ab>
<ab n="10">And the
yong men that were brought vp with him, spake vnto him, saying,
Thus shalt thou answere the people that spake vnto thee, saying,
Thy father made our yoke heauy, but make thou it somewhat lighter
for vs: thus shalt thou say vnto them, My litle finger shall be
thicker then my fathers loynes.</ab>
<ab n="11">For where
as my father put a heauy yoke vpon you, I will put more to your
yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you
with scorpions.<note> Heb. laded.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">So Ieroboam
and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the King
bade, saying, Come againe to me on the third day.</ab>
<ab n="13">And the
king answered them roughly, and king Rehoboam forsooke the counsell
of the old men,</ab>

<fw>Israel reuolteth.</fw>
<ab n="14">And
answered them after the aduice of the yong men, saying, My father
made your yoke heauy, but I will adde thereto: my father chastised
you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</ab>
<ab n="15">So the king
hearkened not vnto the people, for the cause was of God, that the
Lord might performe his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah
the Shilonite to Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat.<note> 1.King.11 29.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">¶ And
when all Israel sawe that the king would not hearken vnto them, the
people answered the king saying, What portion haue wee in Dauid?
and wee haue none inheritance in the sonne of Iesse: Euery man to
your tents, O Israel: and now Dauid, see to thine owne house. So
all Israel went to their tents.</ab>
<ab n="17">But as for
the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Iudah, Rehoboam
reigned ouer them.</ab>
<ab n="18">Then king
Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was ouer the tribute, and the children
of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died: but king Rehoboam
made speed to get him vp to his charet, to flee to
Ierusalem.<note> Heb. strengthened himselfe.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">And Israel
rebelled against the house of Dauid vnto this day.</ab>
