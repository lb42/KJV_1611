<head>CHAP.
XIV.</head>
<head>1 Christ comforteth his Disciples
with the hope of heauen: 6 professeth himselfe the Way, the Trueth,
and the Life, and one with the Father: 13 Assureth their praiers in
his Name to be effectuall: 15 Requesteth loue and obedience, 16
promiseth the holy Ghost the comforter, 27 and leaueth his peace
with them.</head>

<ab n="1">Let not your
heart be troubled: yee beleeue in God, beleeue also in me.</ab>
<ab n="2">In my Fathers
house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would haue told you:
I goe to prepare a place for you.</ab>
<ab n="3">And if I goe
and prepare a place for you, I will come againe, and receiue you
vnto my selfe, that where I am, there ye may be also.</ab>
<ab n="4">And whither I
goe yee know, and the way ye know.</ab>
<ab n="5">Thomas saith
vnto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest: and how can we know
the way?</ab>
<ab n="6">Iesus saith
vnto him, I am the Way, the Trueth, and the Life: no man commeth
vnto the Father but by mee.</ab>
<ab n="7">If ye had
knowen me, ye should haue knowen my Father also: and from
henceforth ye know him, and haue seene him.</ab>

<fw>Who loueth Christ.</fw>
<ab n="8">Philip sayth
vnto him, Lord, shew vs the Father, and it sufficeth vs.</ab>
<ab n="9">Iesus saith
vnto him, Haue I bin so long time with you, and yet hast thou not
knowen me, Philip? he that hath seene me, hath seene the father,
and how sayest thou then, Shew vs the father?</ab>
<ab n="10">Beleeuest thou not
that I am in the father, and the father in mee? The words that I
speake vnto you, I speak not of my selfe: but the Father that
dwelleth in me, he doth the works.</ab>
<ab n="11">Beleeue me that I
am in the Father, and the Father in mee: or else beleeue me for the
very workes sake.</ab>
<ab n="12">Uerely, verely I
say vnto you, he that beleeueth on me, the works that I doe, shall
hee doe also, and greater workes then these shall he doe, because I
goe vnto my Father.</ab>
<ab n="13">And whatsoeuer ye
shall aske in my Name, that will I doe, that the Father may be
glorified in the Sonne.<note> Mat.7.7.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">If ye shall aske
any thing in my Name, I will doe it.</ab>
<ab n="15">Â¶ If ye loue
me, keepe my commandements.</ab>
<ab n="16">And I will pray the
Father, and hee shall giue you another Comforter, that he may abide
with you for euer,</ab>
<ab n="17">Euen the Spirit of
trueth, whom the world cannot receiue, because it seeth him not,
neither knoweth him: but ye know him, for hee dwelleth with you,
and shall be in you.</ab>
<ab n="18">I wil not leaue you
comfortlesse, I will come to you.<note> Or, orphanes.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">Yet a litle while,
and the world seeth me no more: but ye see me, because I liue, ye
shall liue also.</ab>
<ab n="20">At that day ye
shall know, that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in
you.</ab>
<ab n="21">He that hath my
commandements, and keepeth them, hee it is that loueth me: and he
that loueth me shall be loued of my Father, and I will loue him,
and will manifest my selfe to him.</ab>
<ab n="22">Iudas saith vnto
him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thy
selfe vnto vs, and not vnto the world?</ab>
<ab n="23">Iesus answered, and
saide vnto him, If a man loue mee, he will keepe my wordes: and my
Father will loue him, and wee will come vnto him, and make our
abode with him.</ab>

<fw>The true Vine.</fw>
<ab n="24">He that loueth mee
not, keepeth not my sayings, and the word which you heare, is not
mine, but the Fathers which sent mee.</ab>
<ab n="25">These things haue I
spoken vnto you, being yet present with you.</ab>
<ab n="26">But the Comforter,
which is the holy Ghost, whom the Father wil send in my name, he
shal teach you al things, &amp; bring al things to your
remembrance, whatsoeuer I haue said vnto you.</ab>
<ab n="27">Peace I leaue with
you, my peace I giue vnto you, not as the world giueth, giue I vnto
you: let not your heart bee troubled, neither let it bee
afraid.</ab>
<ab n="28">Ye haue heard how I
saide vnto you, I goe away, and come againe vnto you. If ye loued
mee, yee would reioyce, because I said, I go vnto the Father: for
my Father is greater then I.</ab>
<ab n="29">And now I haue told
you before it come to passe, that when it is come to passe, ye
might beleeue.</ab>
<ab n="30">Heereafter I will
not talke much with you: for the prince of this world commeth, and
hath nothing in me.</ab>
<ab n="31">But that the world
may know that I loue the Father: and as the Father gaue me
commandement, euen so I doe: Arise, let vs goe hence.</ab>
