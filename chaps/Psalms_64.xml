<head>CHAP.
LXIV.</head>
<head>1 Dauid prayeth for deliuerance,
complaining of his enemies. 7 He promiseth himselfe to see such an
euident destruction of his enemies, as the righteous shall reioyce
at it.</head>

<ab n="1">[To the chiefe
musician, a Psalme of Dauid.] Heare my voice, O God, in my praier;
preserue my life from feare of the enemie.</ab>
<ab n="2">Hide me from the
secret counsel of the wicked: from the insurrection of the workers
of iniquitie:</ab>
<ab n="3">Who whet their
tongue like a sword, and bend their bowes to shoote their arrowes,
euen bitter words:<note> Psal.11.3.</note></ab>

<fw>Gods chosen: Their benefits.</fw>
<ab n="4">That they may
shoote in secret at the perfect: suddenly doe they shoote at him,
and feare not.</ab>
<ab n="5">They incourage
themselues in an euill matter: they commune of laying snares
priuily; they say, Who shall see them?<note> Or, speech. , Heb. to hide snares.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">They search out
iniquities, they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward
thought of euery one of them, and the heart, is deepe.<note> Or, we are confirmed by that which they haue throughly searched. , Heb. a search, searched.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">But God shall
shoote at them: with an arrowe, sodenly shall they be
wounded.<note> Heb. their wound shalbe.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">So they shall make
their owne tongue to fall vpon themselues: all that see them, shall
flee away.</ab>
<ab n="9">And all men shall
feare, and shall declare the worke of God; for they shall wisely
consider of his doing.</ab>
<ab n="10">The righteous
shalbe glad in the Lord, and shall trust in him; and all the
vpright in heart shall glory.</ab>
