<head>CHAP. IX.</head>
<head>1 The description of the rites and
bloody sacrifices of the Law, 11 farre inferiour to the dignitie
and perfection of the blood and sacrifice of Christ.</head>

<ab n="1">Then verily the
first Couenant had also ordinances of diuine Seruice, and a worldly
Sanctuary.<note> Or, ceremonies.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">For there was a
Tabernacle made, the first, wherein was the Candlesticke, and the
Table, and the Shewbread, which is called the
Sanctuarie.<note> Or, holy.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And after the
second vaile, the Tabernacle which is called Ã¾e
Holiest of all:</ab>
<ab n="4">Which had the
golden Censor, and the Arke of the Couenant ouerlayed round about
with gold, wherein was the Golden pot that had Manna, and Aarons
rod that budded, and the Tables of the Couenant.</ab>
<ab n="5">And ouer it the
Cherubims of glory shadowing the Mercyseat; of which we cannot now
speake particularly.</ab>
<ab n="6">Now when these
things were thus ordained, the Priestes went alwayes into the first
Tabernacle, accomplishing the seruice of God.</ab>
<ab n="7">But into the
second went the high Priest alone once euery yeere, not without
blood, which he offered for himselfe, and for the errors of the
people.</ab>
<ab n="8">The holy Ghost
this signifying, that the way into the Holiest of all, was not yet
made manifest, while as the first Tabernacle was yet
standing:</ab>
<ab n="9">Which was a figure
for the time then present, in which were offred both gifts and
sacrifices, that could not make him that did the seruice perfect,
as pertayning to the conscience,</ab>
<ab n="10">Which stood onely
in meates and drinkes, and diuers washings, and carnall ordinances
imposed on them vntill the time of reformation.<note> Or, rites, or ceremonies.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">But Christ being
come an high Priest of good things to come, by a greater and more
perfect Tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of
this building:</ab>

<fw>The force of Christes death.</fw>
<ab n="12">Neither by the
blood of Goats and Calues: but by his owne blood hee entred in once
into the Holy place, hauing obtained eternall redemption for
vs.</ab>
<ab n="13">For if the blood
of Bulls, and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the
vncleane, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:</ab>
<ab n="14">How much more
shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit, offered
himselfe without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead
workes, to serue the liuing God?<note> Or, fault.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">And for this
cause hee is the Mediatour of the New Testament, that by meanes of
death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were vnder the
first Testament, they which are called, might receiue the promise
of eternall inheritance.</ab>
<ab n="16">For where a
Testament is, there must also of necessitie bee the death of the
Testatour.<note> Or, bee brought in.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">For a Testament
is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at
all whilest the Testatour liueth.</ab>
<ab n="18">Whereupon,
neither the first Testament was dedicated without
blood.<note> Or, purified.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">For when Moses
had spoken euery precept to all the people according to the Law, he
tooke the blood of Calues and of Goates, with water and scarlet
wooll, and hysope, and sprinckled both the booke and all the
people,<note> Or, purple.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">Saying, This is
the blood of the Testament which God hath enioyned vnto
you.</ab>
<ab n="21">Moreouer, hee
sprinkled with blood both the Tabernacle, and all the vessels of
the Ministery.</ab>
<ab n="22">And almost all
things are by the Law purged with blood: and without shedding of
blood is no remission.</ab>
<ab n="23">It was therefore
necessary that the patterns of things in the heauens should bee
purified with these, but the heauenly things themselues with better
sacrifices then these.</ab>
<ab n="24">For Christ is not
entred into the Holy places made with handes, which are the figures
of the true, but into heauen it selfe, now to appeare in the
presence of God for vs.</ab>
<ab n="25">Nor yet that he
should offer himselfe often, as the high Priest entreth into the
Holy place, euery yeere with blood of others:</ab>

<fw>The force of Christes death.</fw>
<ab n="26">For then must hee
often haue suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once
in the end of the world, hath he appeared to put away sinne by the
sacrifice of himselfe.</ab>
<ab n="27">And as it is
appointed vnto men once to die, but after this the
Iudgement:</ab>
<ab n="28">So Christ was
once offered to beare the sinnes of many, &amp; vnto them that
looke for him shall hee appeare the second time without sinne, vnto
saluation.</ab>
