<ab n="1">Moreouer the word
of the Lord came vnto mee, saying;</ab>
<ab n="2">Also thou sonne of
man, thus saith the Lord God vnto the land of Israel, An end, the
ende is come vpon the foure corners of the land.</ab>
<ab n="3">Now is the ende
come vpon thee, and I will send mine anger vpon thee, and will
iudge thee according to thy wayes, and will recompense vpon thee
all thine abominations.<note> Heb. giue.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">And mine eye shal
not spare thee, neither will I haue pitie: but I will recompense
thy wayes vpon thee, and thine abominations shalbe in the midst of
thee, and yee shall know that I am the Lord.</ab>

<fw>The desolation of Israel.</fw>
<ab n="5">Thus sayth the
Lord God, An euill, an onely euill, behold, is come.</ab>
<ab n="6">An end is come,
the end is come, it watcheth for thee, behold, it is
come.<note> Heb. awaketh against thee.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">The morning is
come vnto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come,
the day of trouble is neere, and not the sounding againe of the
mountaines.<note> Or, eccho.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Now will I shortly
powre out my furie vpon thee, and accomplish mine anger vpon thee:
and I wil iudge thee according to thy wayes, and will recompense
thee for all thine abominations.</ab>
<ab n="9">And mine eye shall
not spare, neither will I haue pitie: I will recompense thee
according to thy wayes, and thine abominations that are in the
middest of thee, and yee shall know that I am the Lord that
smiteth.<note> Heb. vpon thee.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">Behold the day,
behold, it is come, the morning is gone foorth, the rodde hath
blossomed, pride hath budded.</ab>
<ab n="11">Uiolence is risen
vp into a rod of wickednesse: none of them shall remaine, nor of
their multitude, nor of any of theirs, neither shall there be
wailing for them.<note> Or, their tumultuous persons. Hebr. tumult.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">The time is come,
the day draweth neere, let not the buyer reioyce, nor the seller
mourne: for wrath is vpon all the multitude thereof.</ab>
<ab n="13">For the seller
shall not returne to that which is solde, although they were yet
aliue: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof which
shal not returne: neither shall any strengthen himselfe in the
iniquity of his life.<note> Heb. thogh their life were yet among the liuing. , Or, whose life is in his iniquitie. Heb. his iniquitie.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">They haue blowen
the trumpet, euen to make all ready, but none goeth to the battell:
for my wrath is vpon all the multitude thereof.</ab>
<ab n="15">The sword is
without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in
the field shall die with the sword, and hee that is in the city,
famine and pestilence shall deuoure him.</ab>
<ab n="16">¶ But they
that escape of them, shall escape, and shall be on the mountaines
like doues of the valleys, all of them mourning, euery one for his
iniquitie.</ab>
<ab n="17">All hands shall
be feeble, and all knees shalbe weake as water.<note> Isai. 13.7. iere. 6.24. , Heb. goe into water.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">They shall also
girde themselues with sackcloth, and horrour shall couer them, and
shame shall be vpon all faces, and baldnesse vpon all their
heads.<note> Isa.15.2,3. iere.48.37.</note></ab>

<fw>Gods iudgements.</fw>
<ab n="19">They shall cast
their siluer in the streets, and their golde shalbe remooued: their
siluer and their golde shall not be able to deliuer them in the day
of the wrath of the Lord: they shall not satisfie their soules,
neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumbling blocke of
their iniquitie.<note> Heb. for a separation or vncleannesse. , Prou.11. 4. zeph.1. 18. ecclus. 5.8. , Or, because their iniquitie is their stumbling blocke.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">¶ As for the
beautie of his ornament, he set it in maiestie: but they made the
images of their abominations, and of their detestable things
therein: therefore haue I set it farre from them.<note> Or, made it vnto them an vncleane thing.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">And I will giue
it into the hands of the strangers for a pray, and to the wicked of
the earth for a spoile, and they shall pollute it.</ab>
<ab n="22">My face will I
turne also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for
the robbers shall enter into it and defile it.<note> Or, burglers.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">¶ Make a
chaine: for the land is full of bloody crimes, the citie is full of
violence.</ab>
<ab n="24">Wherfore I will
bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possesse their
houses: I will also make the pompe of the strong to cease, and
their holy places shall be defiled.<note> Or, they shall inherit their holy places.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">Destruction
commeth, and they shall seeke peace, and there shall be
none.<note> Heb. cutting off.</note></ab>
<ab n="26">Mischiefe shall
come vpon mischiefe, and rumour shall be vpon rumour, then shall
they seeke a vision of the prophet: but the law shall perish from
the priest, and counsell from the ancients.</ab>
<ab n="27">The king shall
mourne, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the
hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will doe vnto
them after their way, and according to their deserts will I iudge
them, and they shall know that I am the Lord.<note> Heb. with their iudgements.</note></ab>
