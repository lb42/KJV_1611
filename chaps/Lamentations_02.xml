<head>CHAP. II.</head>
<head>1 Ieremiah lamenteth the misery of
Ierusalem. 20 He complaineth thereof to God.</head>

<ab n="1">How hath the
Lord couered the daughter of Zion with a cloud, in his anger, and
cast downe from heauen vnto the earth the beautie of Israel, and
remembred not his footstoole in the day of his anger?</ab>
<ab n="2">The Lord hath
swallowed vp all the habitations of Iacob, and hath not pitied: he
hath throwen downe in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of
Iudah: he hath brought them down to the ground: hee hath polluted
the kingdome and the princes thereof.<note> Heb. made to couch.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">He hath cut
off in his fierce anger all the horne of Israel: he hath drawen
backe his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against
Iacob like a flaming fire which deuoureth round about.</ab>
<ab n="4">He hath bent
his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an
aduersary, and slew all that were pleasant to the eye, in the
tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he powred out his furie like
fire.<note> Heb. all the desireable of the eye.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">The Lord was
an enemie: he hath swallowed vp Israel, hee hath swallowed vp all
her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased
in the daughter of Iudah mourning and lamentation.</ab>

<fw>Gods indignation on Ierusalem.</fw>
<ab n="6">And he hath
violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden, hee
hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the Lord hath caused the
solemne feasts and Sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath
despised in the indignation of his anger the King and the
Priest.<note> Psal.80. 13. and 89. 41. and isa. 5.5. , Or, hedge.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">The Lord hath
cast off his Altar: hee hath abhorred his Sanctuarie: he hath giuen
vp into the hand of the enemie the walles of her palaces: they haue
made a noise in the house of the Lord, as in the day of a solemne
Feast.<note> Heb. shut vp.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">The Lord hath
purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath
stretched out a line: he hath not withdrawen his hand from
destroying: therefore hee made the rampart and the wall to lament:
they languished together.<note> Hebr. swallowing vp.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">Her gates are
sunke into the ground: he hath destroyed and broken her barres: her
King and her Princes are among the Gentiles: the Law is no more,
her prophets also finde no vision from the Lord.<note> Psal.74. 9.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">The Elders
of the daughter of Zion sit vpon the ground and keepe silence: they
haue cast vp dust vpon their heads: they haue girded themselues
with sackcloth: the virgins of Ierusalem hang downe their heades to
the ground.</ab>
<ab n="11">Mine eyes
doe faile with teares: my bowels are troubled: my liuer is powred
vpon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people,
because the children and the sucklings swoone in the streets of the
citie.<note> Or, faint.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">They say to
their mothers, Where is corne and wine? when they swooned as the
wounded in the streets of the citie, when their soule was powred
out into their mothers bosome.</ab>
<ab n="13">What thing
shall I take to witnesse for thee? what thing shall I liken to
thee, O daughter of Ierusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I
may comfort thee, O Uirgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is
great like the sea: who can heale thee?</ab>
<ab n="14">Thy Prophets
haue seene vaine and foolish things for thee, and they haue not
discouered thine iniquitie, to turne away thy captiuitie: but haue
seene for thee false burdens, and causes of banishment.<note> Iere.2.8. and 5.31. and 14.14. and 23.16.</note></ab>

<fw>Gods indignation on Ierusalem.</fw>
<ab n="15">All that
passe by, clap their hands at thee: they hisse and wagge their head
at the daughter of Ierusalem, saying, Is this the citie that men
call the perfection of beauty, the ioy of the whole
earth?<note> Hebr. by the way. , Psal.48.2.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">All thine
enemies haue opened their mouth against thee: they hisse and gnash
the teeth: they say, We haue swallowed her vp: certainly this is
the day that we looked for: we haue found, we haue seene
it.</ab>
<ab n="17">The Lord
hath done that which he had deuised: he hath fulfilled his word
that he had commanded in the dayes of old: hee hath throwen downe
and hath not pitied: and he hath caused thine enemie to reioyce
ouer thee, hee hath set vp the horne of thine
aduersaries.<note> Leuit.26. 16. deut. 28. 15.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Their heart
cried vnto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let teares
runne downe like a riuer, day and night: giue thy selfe no rest,
let not the apple of thine eyes cease.<note> Iere. 14. 17. chap. 1. 16.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">Arise, cry
out in the night: in the beginning of the watches powre out thine
heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift vp thy handes
toward him, for the life of thy yong children, that faint for
hunger in the top of euery streete.</ab>
<ab n="20">Â¶
Behold, O Lord, and consider to whom thou hast done this: shal the
women eat their fruit, and children of a spanne long? shall the
priest and the prophet be slaine in the Sanctuary of the
Lord?<note> Or, swadled with their hands.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">The yong and
the old lye on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my yong
men are fallen by the sword: thou hast slaine them in the day of
thy anger: thou hast killed, and not pitied.</ab>
<ab n="22">Thou hast
called as in a solemne day my terrours round about, so that in the
day of the Lords anger, none escaped nor remained: those that I
haue swadled and brought vp, hath mine enemy consumed.</ab>
