perfect.<note> Chap.5. 22. , Or, vpright or sincere.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And I wil make my
couenant betweene me and thee, and will multiply thee
exceedingly.</ab>
<ab n="3">And Abram fell on
his face, and God talked with him, saying,</ab>
<ab n="4">As for me,
behold, my couenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of
many nations.<note> Heb. multitude of nations.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">Neither shall thy
name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall bee Abraham: for
a father of many nations haue I made thee.<note> Rom.4.17</note></ab>
<ab n="6">And I will make
thee exceeding fruitfull, and I will make nations of thee, and
Kings shall come out of thee.</ab>
<ab n="7">And I will
establish my couenant betweene me and thee, and thy seede after
thee, in their generations for an euerlasting couenant, to bee a
God vnto thee, and to thy seed after thee.</ab>
<ab n="8">And I will giue
vnto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a
stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an euerlasting possession,
and I will be their God.<note> Heb. of thy soieurnings.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">¶ And God
said vnto Abraham, Thou shalt keepe my couenant therefore, thou,
and thy seede after thee, in their generations.</ab>
<ab n="10">This is my
couenant, which yee shall keepe betweene me and you, and thy seed
after thee: euery man child among you shall be
circumcised.<note> Acts 7. 8.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And ye shall
circumcise the flesh of your foreskinne; and it shal be a token of
the couenant betwixt me and you.<note> Acts 7.8. rom.4.11.</note></ab>

money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.<note> Hebr. a sonne of eight dayes. , Leuit. 12. 3. luke 2.21 iohn 7.22.</note></ab>

<fw>Of Circumcision.</fw>
<ab n="13">He that is borne
in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be
circumcised: and my couenant shall be in your flesh, for an
euerlasting couenant.</ab>
<ab n="14">And the
vncircumcised man-child, whose flesh of his foreskinne is not
circumcised, that soule shall be cut off from his people: hee hath
broken my couenant.</ab>
<ab n="15">¶ And God
said vnto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her
name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.</ab>
<ab n="16">And I will
blesse her, and giue thee a sonne also of her: yea I wil blesse
her, and she shalbe a mother of nations; Kings of people shall be
of her.<note> Hebr. she shall become nations.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">Then Abraham
fell vpon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a
child be borne vnto him that is an hundred yeeres old? and shal
Sarah that is ninetie yeeres old, beare?</ab>
<ab n="18">And Abraham said
vnto God, O that Ishmael might liue before thee.</ab>
<ab n="19">And God said,
Sarah thy wife shall beare thee a sonne in deede, and thou shalt
call his name Isaac: and I will establish my couenant with him, for
an euerlasting couenant, and with his seed after him.<note> Chap. 18. 10. and 21. 2.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">And as for
Ishmael, I haue heard thee: behold, I haue blessed him, and will
make him fruitfull, and will multiplie him exceedingly: Twelue
princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great
nation.<note> Gene. 25. 12.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">But my couenant
wil I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall beare vnto thee, at
this set time, in the next yeere.</ab>
<ab n="22">And he left off
talking with him, and God went vp from Abraham.</ab>
<ab n="23">¶ And
Abraham tooke Ishmael his sonne, and all that were borne in his
house, and all that were bought with his money, euery male, among
the men of Abrahams house, and circumcised the flesh of their
foreskinne, in the selfesame day, as God had said vnto him.</ab>

ninety yeeres old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of
his foreskinne.</ab>
<ab n="25">And Ishmael his
sonne was thirteene yeeres old, when he was circumcised in the
flesh of his foreskinne.</ab>
<ab n="26">In the selfe
same day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his sonne.</ab>

<fw>Three Angels.</fw>

of his house, borne in the house, and bought with money of the
