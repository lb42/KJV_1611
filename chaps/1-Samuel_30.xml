XXX.</head>
<head>1 The Amalekites spoile Ziklag. 4
Dauid asking counsell, is encouraged by God to pursue them. 11 By
the meanes of a reuiued Egyptian, he is brought to the enemies, and
recouereth all the spoile. 22 Dauids law to diuide the spoile
equally betweene them that fight, and them that keepe the stuffe.
26 He sendeth presents to his friends.</head>

<ab n="1">And it came to
passe when Dauid and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day,
that the Amalekites had inuaded the South and Ziklag, and smitten
Ziklag, and burnt it with fire:</ab>
<ab n="2">And had taken
the women captiues, that were therein; they slewe not any either
great or smal, but caried them away, and went on their way.</ab>
<ab n="3">¶ So Dauid
and his men came to the citie, and beholde, it was burnt with fire,
and their wiues, and their sonnes, and their daughters were taken
captiues.</ab>
<ab n="4">Then Dauid and
the people that were with him, lift vp their voice, and wept,
vntill they had no more power to weepe.</ab>
<ab n="5">And Dauids two
wiues were taken captiues, Ahinoam the Iezreelitesse, and Abigail
the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</ab>

<fw>Dauid pursueth them.</fw>
<ab n="6">And Dauid was
greatly distressed: for the people spake of stoning him, because
the soule of all the people was grieued, euery man for his sonnes,
and for his daughters: but Dauid encouraged himselfe in the Lord
his God.<note> Heb. bitter.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">And Dauid said
to Abiathar the Priest Ahimelechs sonne, I pray thee, bring mee
hither the Ephod: and Abiathar brought thither the Ephod to
Dauid.</ab>
<ab n="8">And Dauid
enquired at the Lord, saying; Shall I pursue after this troupe?
shall I ouertake them? And he answered him, Pursue, for thou shalt
surely ouertake them, and without faile recouer all.</ab>
<ab n="9">So Dauid went,
hee, and the sixe hundred men that were with him, and came to the
brooke Besor, where those that were left behinde, stayed.</ab>
<ab n="10">But Dauid
pursued, he and foure hundred men: (for two hundred abode behinde,
which were so faint that they could not goe ouer the brooke
Besor.)</ab>
<ab n="11">¶ And they
found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to Dauid, and gaue
him bread, and he did eate, and they made him drinke water.</ab>
<ab n="12">And they gaue
him a piece of a cake of figges, and two clusters of raisins: and
when hee had eaten, his spirit came againe to him: for hee had
eaten no bread, nor drunke any water, three dayes and three
nights.</ab>
<ab n="13">And Dauid sayde
vnto him, To whome belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he
said, I am a yong man of Egypt, seruant to an Amalekite, and my
master left me, because three dayes agone I fell sicke.</ab>
<ab n="14">Wee made an
inuasion vpon the South of the Cherethites, and vpon the coast
which belongeth to Iudah, and vpon the South of Caleb, and wee
burnt Ziklag with fire.</ab>
<ab n="15">And Dauid sayde
to him, Canst thou bring me downe to this company? And he said,
Sweare vnto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliuer
mee into the handes of my master, and I will bring thee downe to
this company.</ab>
<ab n="16">¶ And when
he had brought him downe, behold, they were spread abroad vpon all
the earth, eating and drinking, and dauncing, because of all the
great spoile that they had taken out of the land of the
Philistines, and out of the land of Iudah.</ab>

<fw>Dauids spoile.</fw>
<ab n="17">And Dauid smote
them from the twilight, euen vnto the euening of the next day: and
there escaped not a man of them, saue foure hundred yong men which
rode vpon camels, and fled.<note> Heb. their morrow.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">And Dauid
recouered all that the Amalekites had caried away: and Dauid
rescued his two wiues.</ab>
<ab n="19">And there was
nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sonnes
nor daughters, neither spoile, nor any thing that they had taken to
them: Dauid recouered all.</ab>
<ab n="20">And Dauid tooke
all the flockes, and the herds, which they draue before those other
cattell, and said, This is Dauids spoile.</ab>
<ab n="21">¶ And
Dauid came to the two hundred men which were so faint that they
could not follow Dauid, whome they had made also to abide at the
brook Besor: and they went forth to meet Dauid, and to meete the
people, that were with him; and when Dauid came neere to the
people, he saluted them.<note> Or, asked them howe they did.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">Then answered
all the wicked men, and men of Belial, of those that went with
Dauid, and said, Because they went not with vs, we wil not giue
them ought of the spoile, that wee haue recouered, saue to euery
man his wife and his children, that they may leade them away, and
depart.<note> Heb. men.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">Then said
Dauid, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the Lord
hath giuen vs, who hath preserued vs, and deliuered the companie
that came against vs, into our hand.</ab>
<ab n="24">For who will
hearken vnto you in this matter? But as his part is that goeth
downe to the battell, so shall his part bee that tarieth by the
stuffe: they shall part alike.</ab>
<ab n="25">And it was so
from that day forward, that he made it a statute, and an ordinance
for Israel, vnto this day.<note> Heb. and forward.</note></ab>
<ab n="26">¶ And when
Dauid came to Ziklag, hee sent of the spoile vnto the Elders of
Iudah, euen to his friends, (saying, Behold a Present for you, of
the spoile of the enemies of the Lord )<note> Heb. blessing.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">To them which
were in Bethel, and to them which were in South Ramoth, and to them
which were in Iattir,</ab>
<ab n="28">And to them
which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to
them which were in Eshtemoa,</ab>

<fw>Sauls death.</fw>
<ab n="29">And to them
which were in Rachal, and them which were in the cities of the
Ierahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the
Kenites,</ab>
<ab n="30">And to them
which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chorashan, and to
them which were in Athach,</ab>
<ab n="31">And to them
which were in Hebron, and to all the places where Dauid himselfe
and his men were wont to haunt.</ab>
