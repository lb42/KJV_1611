<head>1 An exhortation to repentance. 4 A
complaint of their vntowardnesse, and iniquitie.</head>

<ab n="1">Come, and let
vs returne vnto the Lord: for hee hath torne, and hee will heale
vs: he hath smitten, and he will binde vs vp.</ab>
<ab n="2">After two
daies will he reuiue vs, in the third day he will raise vs vp, and
we shall liue in his sight.<note> 1.Cor.15. 4.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">Then shal we
know, if we follow on to know the Lord: his going forth is
prepared, as the morning; &amp; he shall come vnto vs, as the
raine; as the latter and former raine vnto the earth.</ab>
<ab n="4">Â¶ O
Ephraim, what shall I doe vnto thee? O Iudah, what shall I do vnto
thee? for your goodnesse is as a morning cloud, and as the early
dew it goeth away.<note> Or, mercy, or, kindnesse.</note></ab>

<fw>Mercy preferred.</fw>
<ab n="5">Therefore haue
I shewed them by the Prophets: I haue slaine them by the wordes of
my mouth, and thy iudgements are as the light that goeth
foorth.<note> Or, that thy iudgements might be, &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">For I desired
mercie, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more then burnt
offerings.<note> Matth.9. 13. and 10. 7. eccles. 4. 17. 1.sam. 15.22.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">But they like
men haue transgressed the Couenant: there haue they dealt
treacherously against me.<note> Or, like Adam.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Gilead is a
city of them that worke iniquitie; and is polluted with
blood.<note> Or, cunning for blood.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And as troupes
of robbers waite for a man, so the company of priestes murther in
the way by consent: for they commit lewdnesse.<note> Hebr. with one shoulder. Or, to Sichem. , Or, enormitie.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">I haue seene an
horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredome of
Ephraim, Israel is defiled.</ab>
<ab n="11">Also O Iudah, hee
hath set an haruest for thee, when I returned the captiuitie of my
people.</ab>
