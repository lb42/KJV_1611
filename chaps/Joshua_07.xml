<fw>Israel repelled at Ai.</fw>
<ab n="1">But the
children of Israel committed a trespasse in the accursed thing: for
Achan the sonne of Carmi, the sonne of Zabdi, the sonne of Zerah,
of the tribe of Iudah, tooke of the accursed thing: and the anger
of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel.<note> Chap.22. 20. 1.chron. 2.7.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And Ioshua
sent men from Iericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-auen, on the East
side of Bethel, and spake vnto them, saying, Goe vp and view the
countrey. And the men went vp, and viewed Ai.</ab>
<ab n="3">And they
returned to Ioshua, and said vnto him, Let not all the people goe
vp: but let about two or three thousand men goe vp, and smite Ai,
and make not all the people to labour thither, for they are but
few.<note> Heb. about 2000.men: or, about 3000.men.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">So there went
vp thither of the people about three thousand men, and they fled
before the men of Ai.</ab>
<ab n="5">And the men
of Ai smote of them about thirty and sixe men: for they chased them
from before the gate euen vnto Shebarim, and smote them in the
going downe: Wherefore the hearts of the people melted, &amp;
became as water.<note> Or, in Morad.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">¶ And
Ioshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth vpon his face,
before the Arke of the Lord, vntill the euentide, he and the Elders
of Israel, and put dust vpon their heads.</ab>
<ab n="7">And Ioshua
said, Alas, O Lord God, wherefore hast thou at all brought this
people ouer Iordan, to deliuer vs into the hand of the Amorites, to
destroy vs? Would to God we had bene content, and dwelt on the
other side Iordan.</ab>
<ab n="8">Oh Lord! what
shall I say, when Israel turneth their backes before their
enemies?<note> Hebr. neckes.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">For the
Canaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land shall heare of it,
and shall enuiron vs round, and cut off our name from the earth:
and what wilt thou doe vnto thy great Name?</ab>
<ab n="10">¶ And the
Lord saide vnto Ioshua, Get thee vp; wherefore liest thou thus vpon
thy face?<note> Heb. fallest.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">Israel hath
sinned, and they haue also transgressed my Couenant which I
commaunded them: for they haue euen taken of the accursed thing,
and haue also stollen, and dissembled also, and they haue put it
euen amongst their owne stuffe.</ab>
<ab n="12">Therefore the
children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned
their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed:
neither will I bee with you any more, except yee destroy the
accursed from amongst you.</ab>

<fw>Achans trespasse, and
punishment.</fw>
<ab n="13">Up, sanctifie the
people, and say, Sanctifie your selues against to morrow: for thus
saith the Lord God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the
midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies,
vntill ye take away the accursed thing from among you.</ab>
<ab n="14">In the morning
therefore ye shal be brought, according to your tribes: and it
shall be that the tribe which the Lord taketh, shall come according
to the families thereof, and the familie which the Lord shall take,
shal come by housholdes: and the housholdes which the Lord shall
take, shal come man by man.</ab>
<ab n="15">And it shalbe that
he that is taken with the accursed thing, shall bee burnt with
fire, he, and all that hee hath: because he hath transgressed the
couenant of the Lord, and because hee hath wrought folly in
Israel.<note> Or, wickednesse.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">¶ So Ioshua
rose vp earely in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes,
and the tribe of Iudah was taken.</ab>
<ab n="17">And hee brought
the familie of Iudah, and he tooke the familie of the Zarhites: and
he brought the familie of the Zarhites, man by man, and Zabdi was
taken.</ab>
<ab n="18">And hee brought
his houshold, man by man, and Achan the sonne of Carmi, the sonne
of Zabdi, the sonne of Zerah, of the tribe of Iudah, was
taken.</ab>
<ab n="19">And Ioshua said
vnto Achan, My sonne, giue, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of
Israel, and make confession vnto him, and tel me now, what thou
hast done, hide it not from me.</ab>
<ab n="20">And Achan answered
Ioshua, and said, Indeed I haue sinned against the Lord God of
Israel, and thus and thus haue I done.</ab>
<ab n="21">When I saw among
the spoiles a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of
siluer, and a wedge of gold of fiftie shekels weight, then I
coueted them, and tooke them, and behold, they are hid in the earth
in the midst of my tent, and the siluer vnder it.<note> Heb. tongue</note></ab>
<ab n="22">¶ So Ioshua
sent messengers, and they ran vnto the tent, and behold, it was hid
in his tent, and the siluer vnder it.</ab>

<fw>Achans trespasse, and
punishment.</fw>
<ab n="23">And they tooke
them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them vnto Ioshua,
and vnto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the
Lord.<note> Heb. powred.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">And Ioshua and all
Israel with him tooke Achan the sonne of Zerah, and the siluer, and
the garment, and the wedge of golde, and his sonnes, and his
daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheepe, and his
tent, and all that he had: and they brought them vnto the valley of
Achor.</ab>
<ab n="25">And Ioshua said,
Why hast thou troubled vs? the Lord shall trouble thee this day.
And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire,
after they had stoned them with stones.</ab>
<ab n="26">And they raised
ouer him a great heape of stones vnto this day: so the Lord turned
from the fiercenesse of his anger: Wherefore the name of the place
was called, The valley of Achor, vnto this day.<note> That is, trouble.</note></ab>
