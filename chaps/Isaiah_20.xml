<ab n="2">At the same time
spake the Lord by Isaiah the sonne of Amoz, saying, Go and loose
the sackcloth from off thy loynes, and put off thy shooe from thy
foot: and he did so, walking naked and bare foot.<note> Heb. by the hand of Isaiah.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And the Lord said,
Like as my seruant Isaiah hath walked naked and bare foote three
yeeres for a signe and wonder vpon Egypt and vpon Ethiopia:</ab>
<ab n="4">So shall the king
of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians
captiues, yong and old, naked and bare foote, euen with their
buttocks vncouered, to the shame of Egypt.<note> Heb. the captiuitie of Egypt. , Heb. nakednesse.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">And they shall be
afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt
their glory.</ab>

<fw>Babylons fall.</fw>
<ab n="6">And the inhabitant
of this yle shall say in that day; Behold, such is our expectation
whither we flee for helpe to be deliuered from the king of Assyria:
and how shall we escape?<note> Or, countrey.</note></ab>
