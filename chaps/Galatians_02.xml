<head>CHAP. II.</head>
<head>1 He sheweth when he went vp againe
to Hierusalem, and for what purpose: 3 And that Titus was not
circumcised: 11 And that he resisted Peter, and told him the
reason, 14 why hee and other being Iewes, doe beleeue in Christ to
bee Iustified by faith, and not by workes: 20 And that they liue
not in sinne, who are so iustified.</head>

<ab n="1">Then fourteene
yeeres after, I went vp againe to Ierusalem with Barnabas, and
tooke Titus with me also.</ab>
<ab n="2">And I went vp by
reuelation, and communicated vnto them that Gospel, which I preach
among the Gentiles, but priuately to them which were of reputation,
lest by any meanes I should runne, or had runne in
vaine.<note> Or, seuerally.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">But neither
Titus, who was with me, being a Greeke, was compelled to be
circumcised:</ab>
<ab n="4">And that because
of false brethren vnawares brought in, who came in priuily to spie
out our libertie, which wee haue in Christ Iesus, that they might
bring vs into bondage.</ab>
<ab n="5">To whom wee gaue
place by subiection, no not for an houre, that the trueth of the
Gospel might continue with you.</ab>
<ab n="6">But of these,
who seemed to bee somewhat, (whatsoeuer they were, it maketh no
matter to mee, God accepteth no mans person,) for they who seemed
to be somewhat, in conference added nothing to me.</ab>
<ab n="7">But
contrariwise, when they saw that the Gospel of the vncircumcision
was committed vnto me, as the Gospel of the circumcision was vnto
Peter:</ab>

<fw>Peter reprooued.</fw>
<ab n="8">(For he that
wrought effectually in Peter to the Apostleship of the
circumcision, the same was mightie in me towards the
Gentiles.)</ab>
<ab n="9">And when Iames,
Cephas and Iohn, who seemed to bee pillars, perceiued the grace
that was giuen vnto me, they gaue to me and Barnabas the right
hands of fellowship, that wee should goe vnto the heathen, and they
vnto the circumcision.</ab>
<ab n="10">Onely they
would that wee should remember the poore, the same which I also was
forward to doe.</ab>
<ab n="11">But when Peter
was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to
be blamed.</ab>
<ab n="12">For before that
certaine came from Iames, he did eate with the Gentiles: but when
they were come, hee withdrew, and separated himselfe, fearing them
which were of the Circumcisiō.</ab>
<ab n="13">And the other
Iewes dissembled likewise with him, insomuch that Barnabas also was
caried away with their dissimulation.</ab>
<ab n="14">But when I saw
that they walked not vprightly according to the truth of the
Gospel, I said vnto Peter before them al, If thou, being a Iew,
liuest after the maner of Gentiles, and not as doe the Iewes, why
compellest thou the Gentiles to liue as do the Iewes?</ab>
<ab n="15">We who are
Iewes by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</ab>
<ab n="16">Knowing that a
man is not iustified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of
Iesus Christ, euen we haue beleeued in Iesus Christ, that we might
be iustified by the faith of Christ, and not by the workes of the
Law: for by the workes of the Law shall no flesh be
iustified.</ab>
<ab n="17">But if while we
seeke to be iustified by Christ, wee our selues also are found
sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sinne? God
forbid.</ab>
<ab n="18">For if I build
againe the things which I destroyed, I make my selfe a
transgressour.</ab>
<ab n="19">For I through
þ<note/> Law, am dead to the Law, that I might liue vnto
God.</ab>
<ab n="20">I am crucified
with Christ. Neuertheles, I liue, yet not I, but Christ liueth in
me, and the life which I now liue in the flesh, I liue by the faith
of the sonne of God, who loued mee, and gaue himselfe for
me.</ab>
<ab n="21">I doe not
frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousnes come by the Lawe,
then Christ is dead in vaine.</ab>
