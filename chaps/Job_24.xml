<head>CHAP.
XXIV.</head>
<head>1 Wickednesse goeth often
vnpunished. 17 There is a secret iudgement for the
wicked.</head>

<ab n="1">Why, seeing
Times are not hidden from the Almightie, doe they, that know him
not, see his dayes?</ab>
<ab n="2">Some remooue
the land-markes; they violently take away flocks, and feed
thereof.<note> Deut.19. 14. and 27. 17. , Or, feed them.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">They driue away
the asse of the fatherlesse, they take the widowes oxe for a
pledge.</ab>
<ab n="4">They turne the
needy out of the way: the poore of the earth hide themselues
together.</ab>
<ab n="5">Behold, as
wilde asses in the desart, goe they foorth to their worke, rising
betimes for a pray: the wildernes yeeldeth food for them, and for
their children.</ab>
<ab n="6">They reape
euery one his corne in the fielde: and they gather the vintage of
the wicked.<note> Hebr mingled corne, or dredge. , Hebr. the wicked gather the vintage.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">They cause the
naked to lodge without clothing, that they haue no couering in the
cold.</ab>
<ab n="8">They are wet
with the showres of the mountaines, and imbrace the rocke for want
of a shelter.</ab>
<ab n="9">They plucke the
fatherlesse from the brest, and take a pledge of the poore.</ab>
<ab n="10">They cause him
to go naked without clothing: and they take away the sheafe from
the hungry,</ab>
<ab n="11">Which make
oyle within their walles, and tread their winepresses, and suffer
thirst.</ab>

<fw>The oppression of the wicked.</fw>
<ab n="12">Men groane
from out of the city, and the soule of the wounded crieth out: yet
God layeth not folly to them.</ab>
<ab n="13">They are of
those that rebell against the light, they know not the wayes
thereof, nor abide in the pathes thereof.</ab>
<ab n="14">The murderer
rising with the light, killeth the poore and needy, and in the
night is as a thiefe.</ab>
<ab n="15">The eye also
of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see
me: and disguiseth his face.<note> Hebr setteth his face in secret.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">In the darke
they digge through houses which they had marked for themselues in
the day time: they know not the light.</ab>
<ab n="17">For the
morning is to them euen as the shadow of death: if one know them,
they are in the terrours of the shadow of death.</ab>
<ab n="18">Hee is swift
as the waters, their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth
not the way of the Uineyards.</ab>
<ab n="19">Drought and
heate consume the snow waters: so doeth the graue those which haue
sinned.<note> Hebr. violently take it.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">The wombe
shall forget him, the worme shall feed sweetly on him, hee shall be
no more remembred, and wickednes shalbe broken as a tree.</ab>
<ab n="21">He euill
intreateth the barren, that beareth not: and doeth not good to the
widow.</ab>
<ab n="22">He draweth
also the mighty with his power: he riseth vp, and no man is sure of
life.<note> Or. hee trusteth not his owne life.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">Though it be
giuen him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are
vpon their wayes.</ab>
<ab n="24">They are
exalted for a litle while, but are gone and brought low, they are
taken out of the way as al other, and cut off as the tops of the
eares of corne.<note> Hebr. are not. , Hebr. closed vp.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">And if it be
not so now, who will make mee a liar, and make my speach nothing
worth?</ab>
