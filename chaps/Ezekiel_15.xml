<head>CHAP. XV.</head>
<head>1 By the vnfitnesse of the Vine
branch for any worke, 16 is shewed the reiection of
Ierusalē.</head>

<ab n="1">And the word of
þe Lord came vnto me, saying.</ab>
<ab n="2">Sonne of man,
What is the Uine tree more then any tree, or then a branch which is
among the trees of the forrest?</ab>
<ab n="3">Shall wood bee
taken thereof to doe any worke? or, will men take a pin of it, to
hang any vessell thereon?</ab>
<ab n="4">Behold, it is
cast into the fire for fewell: the fire deuoureth both the ends of
it, and the middest of it is burnt. Is it meete for any
worke?<note> Heb. will it prosper?</note></ab>
<ab n="5">Behold, when it
was whole it was meete for no worke: how much lesse shall it be
meete yet for any worke, when the fire hath deuoured it, and it is
burned?<note> Heb. made fit.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">¶ Therefore
thus saith the Lord God; As the Uine tree among the trees of the
forrest, which I haue giuen to the fire for fewell, so will I giue
the inhabitants of Ierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="7">And I will set my
face against them, they shall goe out from one fire, and another
fire shall deuoure them, and ye shall know that I am the Lord, when
I set my face against them.</ab>
<ab n="8">And I will make
the land desolate, because they haue committed a trespasse, saith
the Lord God.<note> Heb. trespased a trespasse.</note></ab>
