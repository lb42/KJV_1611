<head>CHAP. XV.</head>
<head>1 This prophecie is certaine. 5 God
will take vengeance vpon the wicked, 12 Vpon Egypt, 28 An horrible
vision. 43 Babylon and Asia are threatned.</head>

<ab n="1">Behold, speake
thou in the eares of my people the words of prophesie, which I will
put in thy mouth, saith the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="2">And cause them
to be written in paper: for they are faithfull and true.</ab>
<ab n="3">Feare not the
imaginations against thee, let not the incredulity of them trouble
thee, that speake against thee.</ab>
<ab n="4">For all the
vnfaithfull shall die in their vnfaithfulnesse.</ab>
<ab n="5">Behold, saith
the Lord, I will bring plagues vpon the world; the sword, famine,
death, and destruction.</ab>
<ab n="6">For wickednesse
hath exceedingly polluted the whole earth, and their hurtfull
workes are fulfilled.</ab>
<ab n="7">Therefore saith
the Lord,</ab>
<ab n="8">I will hold my
tongue no more as touching their wickednesse, which they prophanely
commit, neither wil I suffer them in those things, in which they
wickedly exercise themselues: behold, the innocent &amp; righteous
blood cryeth vnto me, and the soules of the iust complaine
continually.<note> Reuel.6. 10. and 19. 2.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And therefore
saith the Lord, I wil surely auenge them, and receiue vnto me, all
the innocent blood from among them.</ab>
<ab n="10">Beholde, my
people is ledde as a flocke to the slaughter: I wil not suffer them
now to dwel in the land of Egypt.</ab>
<ab n="11">But I will
bring them with a mighty hand, and a stretched out arme, and smite
Egypt with plagues as before, and wil destroy al the land
thereof.</ab>
<ab n="12">Egypt shal
mourne, and the foundation of it shall bee smitten with the plague
and punishment, that God shall bring vpon it.</ab>
<ab n="13">They that till
the ground shall mourne: for their seedes shall faile, through the
blasting, and haile, and with a fearefull constellation.</ab>
<ab n="14">Woe to the
world, and them that dwell therein.</ab>
<ab n="15">For the sword
and their destruction draweth nigh, and one people shall stand vp
to fight against another, and swords in their hands.</ab>
<ab n="16">For there
shalbe sedition among men, and inuading one another, they shal not
regard their kings, nor princes, and the course of their actions
shall stand in their power.</ab>
<ab n="17">A man shall
desire to goe into a citie, and shall not be able.</ab>
<ab n="18">For because of
their pride, the cities shalbe troubled, the houses shalbe
destroyed, and men shalbe afraid.</ab>
<ab n="19">A man shall
haue no pitie vpon his neighbour, but shall destroy their houses
with the sword, and spoile their goods, because of the lacke of
bread, and for great tribulation.</ab>
<ab n="20">Behold, saith
God, I will call together all the Kings of the earth to reuerence
me, which are from the rising of the Sunne, from the South, from
the East, and Libanus: to turne themselues one against another, and
repay the things that they haue done to them.</ab>
<ab n="21">Like as they
doe yet this day vnto my chosen, so will I doe also and recompense
in their bosome, Thus saith the Lord God;</ab>
<ab n="22">My right hand
shall not spare the sinners, and my sword shal not cease ouer them,
that shed innocent blood vpon earth.</ab>
<ab n="23">The fire is
gone foorth from his wrath, and hath consumed the foundations of
the earth, and the sinners like the straw that is kindled.</ab>
<ab n="24">Wo to them that
sinne and keepe not my c≈çmandements, saith the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="25">I will not
spare them: goe your way ye children from the power, defile not my
Sanctuary:</ab>
<ab n="26">For the Lord
knoweth all them that sinne against him, and therefore deliuereth
he them vnto death and destruction.</ab>
<ab n="27">For now are the
plagues come vpon the whole earth, and ye shall remaine in them,
for God shal not deliuer you, because ye haue sinned against
him.</ab>
<ab n="28">Behold an
horrible vision, and the appearance thereof from the East.</ab>
<ab n="29">Where the
nations of the dragons of Arabia shall come out with many charets,
and the multitude of them shalbe caried as the winde vpon earth,
that all they which heare them, may feare and tremble.</ab>
<ab n="30">Also the
Carmanians raging in wrath, shall go forth as the wilde bores of
the wood, and with great power shall they come, and ioyne battell
with them, and shall waste a portion of the land of the
Assyrians.</ab>
<ab n="31">And then shall
the dragons haue the vpper hand, remembring their nature, and if
they shall turne themselues, conspiring together in great power to
persecute them,</ab>
<ab n="32">Then these
shalbe troubled, and keepe silence through their power, and shall
flee.</ab>
<ab n="33">And from the
land of the Assyrians, shall the enemy besiege them, and consume
some of them, and in their host shall be feare, and dread and
strife among their kings.<note> Or, against.</note></ab>
<ab n="34">Behold clouds
from the East, and from the North, vnto the South, and they are
very horrible to looke vpon; full of wrath and storme.</ab>
<ab n="35">They shall
smite one vpon another, &amp; they shall smite downe a great
multitude of starres vpon the earth, euen their owne starre; and
blood shalbe from the sword vnto the belly.</ab>
<ab n="36">And doung of
men vnto the camels hough.<note> Or, Pasterne, or litter.</note></ab>
<ab n="37">And there
shalbe great fearefulnesse and trembling vpon earth: and they that
see the wrath, shall be afraid, and trembling shall come vpon
them.</ab>
<ab n="38">And then shall
there come great stormes, from the South, and from the North, &amp;
another part from the West.</ab>
<ab n="39">And strong
winds shal arise from the East, and shall open it, and the cloud
which hee raised vp in wrath, and the starre stirred to cause feare
toward the East and West winde, shalbe destroyed.</ab>
<ab n="40">The great and
mightie cloudes shall be lifted vp full of wrath, and the starre,
that they may make all the earth afraid, and them that dwel
therein, and they shall powre out ouer euery high and eminent
place, an horrible starre.</ab>
<ab n="41">Fire and haile,
and fleeing swords, and many waters, that all fields may be full,
and all riuers with the abundance of great waters.</ab>
<ab n="42">And they shal
breake downe the cities, and walls, mountaines and hils, trees of
the wood, and grasse of the medowes, and their corne.</ab>
<ab n="43">And they shal
goe stedfastly vnto Babylon, and make her afraid.<note> Or, destroy.</note></ab>
<ab n="44">They shall come
to her, and besiege her, the starre and all wrath shall they powre
out vpon her, then shall the dust and smoke goe vp vnto the heauen:
and all they that be about her, shall bewaile her.</ab>
<ab n="45">And they that
remaine vnder her, shall doe seruice vnto them that haue put her in
feare.</ab>
<ab n="46">And thou Asia
that art partaker of the hope of Babylon, and art the glory of her
person:<note> Or, like vnto Babylon.</note></ab>
<ab n="47">Woe be vnto
thee thou wretch, because thou hast made thy selfe like vnto her,
and hast deckt thy daughters in whoredome, that they might please
and glory in thy louers, which haue alway desired to commit
whordome with thee.</ab>
<ab n="48">Thou hast
followed her, that is hated in all her works and inuentions:
therefore sayth God,</ab>
<ab n="49">I will send
plagues vpon thee: widowhood, pouertie, famine, sword, and
pestilence, to waste thy houses with destruction and death.</ab>
<ab n="50">And the glory
of the power shall be dried vp as floure, when the heate shall
arise that is sent ouer thee.</ab>
<ab n="51">Thou shalt bee
weakened as a poore woman with stripes, and as one chastised with
woundes, so that the mightie and louers shall not be able to
receiue thee.</ab>
<ab n="52">Would I with
iealousie haue so proceeded against thee, saith the Lord,</ab>
<ab n="53">If thou haddest
not alway slaine my chosen, exalting the stroke of thine hands,
&amp; saying ouer their dead, when thou wast drunken,<note> Lat. death.</note></ab>
<ab n="54">Set foorth the
beauty of thy countenance.</ab>
<ab n="55">The reward of
thy whoredome shall be in thy bosome, therefore shalt thou receiue
recompense.</ab>
<ab n="56">Like as thou
hast done vnto my chosen, sayth the Lord; euen so shall God doe
vnto thee, and shall deliuer thee into mischiefe.</ab>
<ab n="57">Thy children
shall die of hunger, and thou shalt fall through the sword: thy
cities shalbe broken downe, and all thine shall perish with the
sword in the field.</ab>
<ab n="58">They that be in
the mountaines shall die of hunger, and eate their owne flesh, and
drinke their owne blood, for very hunger of bread, &amp; thirst of
water.</ab>
<ab n="59">Thou, as
vnhappy, shalt come through the Sea, and receiue plagues
againe.</ab>
<ab n="60">And in the
passage, they shall rush on the idle citie, and shall destroy some
portion of thy land, and consume part of thy glory, and shall
returne to Babylon that was destroyed.</ab>
<ab n="61">And thou shalt
be cast downe by them, as stubble, and they shall be vnto thee as
fire,</ab>
<ab n="62">And shall
consume thee and thy cities, thy land and thy mountaines, all thy
woods and thy fruitfull trees shall they burne vp with
fire.</ab>
<ab n="63">Thy children
shall they cary away captiue, and looke what thou hast, they shall
spoile it, and marre the beauty of thy face.<note> Or, blemish.</note></ab>
