<head>1 Iehoash reigneth well all the
dayes of Iehoiada. 4 Hee giueth order for the repaire of the
Temple. 17 Hazael is diuerted from Ierusalem by a present of the
halowed treasures. 19 Iehoash being slaine by his seruants, Amaziah
succeedeth him.</head>

<ab n="1">In the seuenth
yeere of Iehu, Iehoash began to reigne, and fourtie yeeres reigned
he in Ierusalem, and his mothers name was Zibiah of
Beersheba.<note> 2. Chron. 24.1.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And Iehoash did
that which was right in the sight of the Lord all his dayes,
wherein Iehoiada the Priest instructed him.</ab>
<ab n="3">But the high
places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed, and burnt
incense in the high places.</ab>
<ab n="4">¶ And
Iehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things
that is brought into the house of the Lord, euen the money of euery
one that passeth the account, the money that euery man is set at,
and all the money that commeth into any mans heart, to bring into
the house of the Lord,<note> Or, holy things. Heb. holinesses. , Heb. the money of the soules of his estimation. , Heb. ascendeth vpon the heart of a man.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">Let the priests
take it to them, euery man of his acquaintance, and let them
repaire the breaches of the house, wheresoeuer any breach shalbe
found.</ab>
<ab n="6">But it was so
that in the three and twentieth yeere of king Iehoash, the priests
had not repaired the breaches of the house.<note> Heb. in the twentieth yeere, and third yeere.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">Then king Iehoash
called for Iehoiada the priest, and the other priests, and saide
vnto them, Why repaire ye not the breaches of the house? now
therefore receiue no more money of your acquaintance, but deliuer
it for the breaches of the house.</ab>
<ab n="8">And the priests
consented to receiue no more money of the people, neither to
repaire the breaches of the house.</ab>

<fw>Prouision for the Temple.</fw>
<ab n="9">But Iehoiada the
priest tooke a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it
beside the Altar, on the right side, as one commeth into the house
of the Lord, and the priests that kept the doore, put therein all
the money that was brought into the house of the Lord.<note> Heb. threshold.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">And it was so
when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the
kings scribe, and the high priest came vp, and they put vp in bags
and told the money that was found in the house of the
Lord.<note> Or, secretarie. , Heb. bound vp.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And they gaue
the money, being told, into the handes of them that did the worke,
that had the ouersight of the house of the Lord: and they laid it
out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought vpon the house of
the Lord,<note> Hebr. brought it foorth.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">And to Masons,
and hewers of stone, and to buy timber, and hewed stone to repaire
the breaches of the house of the Lord, and for all that was laid
out for the house to repaire it.<note> Heb. went forth.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Howbeit, there
were not made for the house of the Lord, bowles of siluer,
snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of
siluer, of the money that was brought into the house of the
Lord:</ab>
<ab n="14">But they gaue
that to the workemen, and repaired therewith the house of the
Lord.</ab>
<ab n="15">Moreouer, they
reckned not with the men, into whose hand they deliuered the money
to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully.</ab>
<ab n="16">The trespasse
money, and sinnemoney was not brought into the house of the Lord:
it was the Priests.</ab>
<ab n="17">¶ Then
Hazael king of Syria went vp, and fought against Gath, and tooke
it: and Hazael set his face to goe vp to Ierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="18">And Iehoash king
of Iudah tooke all the hallowed things that Iehoshaphat, and
Iehoram, and Ahaziah his fathers, kings of Iudah had dedicate, and
his owne hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the
treasures of the house of the Lord, and in the kings house, and
sent it to Hazael king of Syria, and hee went away from
Ierusalem.<note> Heb. went vp.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">¶ And the
rest of the actes of Iehoash, and all that he did, are they not
written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of
Iudah?</ab>

<fw>Iehoash slaine.</fw>
<ab n="20">And his seruants
arose, and made a conspiracie, and slew Iehoash in the house of
Millo, which goeth downe to Silla.<note> Or, Beth-Millo</note></ab>
<ab n="21">For Iozachar the
sonne of Shimeath, and Iehozabad the sonne of Shomer, his seruants,
smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the
citie of Dauid, and Amaziah his sonne reigned in his stead.</ab>
