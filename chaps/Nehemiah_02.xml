<head>CHAP. II.</head>
<head>1 Artaxerxes vnderstanding the cause
of Nehemiahs sadnesse, sendeth him with letters and commission to
Ierusalem. 9 Nehemiah, to the griefe of the enemies, commeth to
Ierusalem. 12 Hee vieweth secretly the ruines of the walles. 17 He
inciteth the Iewes to build in despite of the enemies.</head>

<ab n="1">And it came to
passe, in the moneth Nisan, in the twentieth yeere of Artaxerxes
the king, that wine was before him: and I tooke vp the wine, and
gaue it vnto the King: now I had not bene beforetime sad in his
presence.</ab>

<fw>His request.</fw>
<ab n="2">Wherefore the
king said vnto me, Why is thy countenance sadde, seeing thou art
not sicke? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was
very sore afraid,</ab>
<ab n="3">And said vnto the
king, Let the king liue for euer: why should not my countenance be
sad, when the city, the place of my fathers Sepulchres, lyeth
waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?</ab>
<ab n="4">Then the king
said vnto me, For what doest thou make request? So I prayed to the
God of heauen.</ab>
<ab n="5">And I said vnto
the king, If it please the king, and if thy seruant haue found
fauour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me vnto Iudah vnto the
City of my fathers sepulchres, that I may build it.</ab>
<ab n="6">And the king
saide vnto mee (the Queene also sitting by him) For how long shall
thy iourney bee? and when wilt thou returne? So it pleased the king
to send me, and I set him a time.<note> Hebr. wife.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">Moreouer I saide
vnto the king, If it please the king, let letters be giuen mee to
the gouernours beyond the Riuer, that they may conuey me ouer, till
I come into Iudah;</ab>
<ab n="8">And a letter vnto
Asaph the keeper of the kings forrest, that he may giue me timber
to make beames for the gates of the palace which appertained to the
house, and for the wall of the Citie, and for the house that I
shall enter into: And the king granted me, according to the good
hand of my God vpon me.</ab>
<ab n="9">¶ Then I
came to the gouernours beyond the riuer, and gaue them the kings
letters: (now the king had sent captaines of the army, and horsemen
with me.)</ab>
<ab n="10">When Sanballat
the Horonite, and Tobiah the seruant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it
grieued them exceedingly, that there was come a man, to seeke the
welfare of the children of Israel.</ab>
<ab n="11">So I came to
Ierusalem, and was there three dayes.</ab>
<ab n="12">¶ And I
arose in the night, I, and some few men with mee, neither tolde I
any man what God had put in my heart to doe at Ierusalem: neither
was there any beast with mee, saue the beast that I rode
vpon.</ab>

<fw>The building of the walles.</fw>
<ab n="13">And I went out
by night, by the gate of the valley, euen before the dragon well,
and to the doung-port, and viewed the walls of Ierusalem, which
were broken downe, and the gates thereof were consumed with
fire.</ab>
<ab n="14">Then I went on
to the gate of the fountaine, and to the kings poole: but there was
no place for the beast that was vnder me, to passe.</ab>
<ab n="15">Then went I vp
in the night by the brooke, and viewed the wall, and turned backe,
and entred by the gate of the valley, and so returned.</ab>
<ab n="16">And the rulers
knew not whither I went, or what I did, neither had I as yet tolde
it to the Iewes, nor to the Priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the
rulers, nor to the rest that did the worke.</ab>
<ab n="17">¶ Then said
I vnto them, Yee see the distresse that we are in, how Ierusalem
lieth waste, and the gates therof are burnt with fire: come, and
let vs builde vp the wall of Ierusalem, that we be no more a
reproch.</ab>
<ab n="18">Then I told them
of the hand of my God, which was good vpon me; as also the kings
wordes that he had spoken vnto me. And they said, Let vs rise vp
and builde. So they strengthened their hands for this good
worke.</ab>
<ab n="19">But when
Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the seruant the Ammonite, and
Geshem the Arabian heard it, they laughed vs to scorne, and
despised vs, and said, What is this thing that yee doe? will ye
rebell against the king?</ab>
<ab n="20">Then answered I
them, and said vnto them, The God of heauen, he will prosper vs,
therefore wee his seruants will arise and build: But you haue no
portion, nor right, nor memoriall in Ierusalem.</ab>
