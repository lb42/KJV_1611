<ab n="1">I saw the Lord
standing vpon the altar, and he said, Smite the lintell of the
doore, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head all of
them, and I will slay the last of them with the sword: hee that
fleeth of them, shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them,
shall not be deliuered.<note> Or, chapiter, or knop. , Or, wound them.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">Though they
digge into hell, thence shall mine hand take them: though they
clime vp to heauen, thence will I bring them downe.<note> Psal. 139. 8. &amp;c:</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And though they
hide themselues in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them
out thence, and though they be hid from my sight in the bottome of
the Sea, thence will I commaund the serpent, and he shall bite
them.</ab>
<ab n="4">And though they
goe into captiuitie before their enemies, thence will I commaund
the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes vpon
them for euill, and not for good.<note> Ier.44. 11.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">And the Lord
God of hostes is he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and
all that dwelleth therein shall mourne, and it shall rise vp wholly
like a flood, and shall be drowned as by the flood of
Egypt.</ab>
<ab n="6">It is he that
buildeth his stories in the heauen, and hath founded his troupe in
the earth, he that calleth for the waters of the Sea, and powreth
them out vpon the face of the earth: the Lord is his
name.<note> Or, spheares heb. ascensions. , Psal. 104. 3. , Or, bundell. , Chap. 5.8.</note></ab>

<fw>The power, and goodnesse of
God.</fw>
<ab n="7">Are yee not as
children of the Ethiopians vnto me, O children of Israel, saith the
Lord ? haue not I brought vp Israel out of the land of Egypt? and
the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?<note> Ier.47. 4.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Behold, the
eyes of the Lord God are vpon the sinfull kingdome, and I will
destroy it from off the face of the earth; sauing that I will not
vtterly destroy the house of Iacob, saith the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="9">For loe, I will
commaund, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations,
like as corne is sifted in a sieue, yet shall not the least graine
fall vpon the earth.<note> Heb. cease to moue. , Heb. stone.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">All the
sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say: The euill
shall not ouertake nor preuent vs.</ab>
<ab n="11">Â¶ In that
day will I raise vp the tabernacle of Dauid, that is fallen, and
close vp the breaches thereof, and I will raise vp his ruines, and
I will build it as in the dayes of old;<note> Acts 15. 16. , Heb. hedge, or wall.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">That they may
possesse the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen; which are
called by my name, saith the Lord that doth this.<note> Heb. vpon whom my name is called.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Behold, the
daies come, saith the Lord, that the plowman shall ouertake the
reaper, &amp; the treader of grapes him that soweth seede, and the
mountaines shall drop sweete wine, and all the hils shall
melt.<note> Heb. draweth forth. , Or, new wine. , Ioel.3. 18.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And I will
bring againe the captiuitie of my people of Israel: and they shall
build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant
vineyards, and drinke the wine thereof: they shall also make
gardens, and eate the fruite of them.</ab>
<ab n="15">And I will
plant them vpon their land, and they shall no more be pulled vp out
of their land, which I haue giuen them, saith the Lord thy
God.</ab>
