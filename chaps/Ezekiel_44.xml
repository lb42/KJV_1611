<fw>The Princes gate.</fw>
<ab n="1">Then he brought
me backe the way of the gate of the outward Sanctuarie which
looketh toward the East, and it was shut.</ab>
<ab n="2">Then said the
Lord vnto me, This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and
no man shall enter in by it; because the Lord the God of Israel
hath entred in by it, therefore it shall be shut.</ab>
<ab n="3">It is for the
Prince; the Prince, hee shall sit in it to eate bread before the
Lord: hee shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and
shall goe out by the way of the same.</ab>
<ab n="4">¶ Then
brought he me the way of the North gate before the house, and I
looked, and behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house of the
Lord, and I fell vpon my face.</ab>
<ab n="5">And the Lord said
vnto me; Sonne of man, marke well, and behold with thine eyes, and
heare with thine eares, all that I say vnto thee, concerning all
the ordinances of the house of ehe Lord, and all the lawes thereof,
and marke well the entring in of the house, with euery going foorth
of the Sanctuary.<note> Heb. set thine heart.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">And thou shalt
say to the rebellious, euen to the house of Israel, Thus sayth the
Lord God; O yee house of Israel, let it suffice you, of all your
abominations;</ab>
<ab n="7">In that ye haue
brought into my Sanctuarie strangers vncircumcised in heart, and
vncircumcised in flesh, to be in my Sanctuarie to pollute it, euen
my House, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they
haue broken my Couenant, because of all your
abominations.<note> Heb. children of a stranger.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">And yee haue not
kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye haue set keepers of my
charge in my Sanctuarie for your selues.<note> Or, ward, or ordinance. And so verse 14. and 16.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">¶ Thus sayth
the Lord God, No stranger vncircumcised in heart, nor vncircumcised
in flesh, shall enter into my Sanctuarie, of any stranger that is
among the children of Israel.</ab>
<ab n="10">And the Leuites
that are gone away farre from me, when Israel went astray, which
went astray away from me after their idoles, they shall euen beare
their iniquitie.</ab>

<fw>The office of the Priests.</fw>
<ab n="11">Yet they shall
be ministers in my Sanctuary, hauing charge at the gates of the
house, and ministring to the house: they shall slay the burnt
offring, and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand
before them to minister vnto them:</ab>
<ab n="12">Because they
ministred vnto them before their idoles, and caused the house of
Israel to fall into iniquitie; therefore haue I lift vp mine hand
against them, saith the Lord God, and they shall beare their
iniquitie.<note> Heb. were for a stumbling blocke of iniquitie vnto &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">And they shall
not come neere vnto me to doe the office of a priest vnto me, nor
to come neere to any of my holy things, in the most holy place: but
they shall beare their shame, and their abominations which they
haue committed.</ab>
<ab n="14">But I will make
them keepers of the charge of the house for all the seruice
thereof, and for all that shalbe done therein.</ab>
<ab n="15">¶ But the
priests the Leuites, the sonnes of Zadok, that kept the charge of
my sanctuarie, when the children of Israel went astray from me,
they shall come neere to me to minister vnto me, and they shall
stand before me to offer vnto me the fat and the blood, saith the
Lord God.</ab>
<ab n="16">They shall enter
into my sanctuarie, and they shall come neere to my table to
minister vnto mee, and they shall keepe my charge.</ab>
<ab n="17">¶ And it
shall come to passe that when they enter in at the gates of the
inner court, they shall be clothed with linnen garments, and no
wooll shall come vpon them, whiles they minister in the gates of
the inner court and within.</ab>
<ab n="18">They shall haue
linnen bonets vpon their heads, and shall haue linnen breeches vpon
their loynes: they shall not girde themselues with any thing that
causeth sweat.<note> Or, in sweating places. Heb. in, or with sweat.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">And when they
goe forth into the vtter court, euen into the vtter court to the
people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministred,
and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other
garments, and they shall not sanctifie the people with their
garments.</ab>
<ab n="20">Neither shall
they shaue their heads, nor suffer their lockes to grow long, they
shall only polle their heads.</ab>

<fw>The office of the Priests.</fw>
<ab n="21">Neither shall
any priest drinke wine, when they enter into the inner
court.</ab>
<ab n="22">Neither shall
they take for their wiues a widow, or her that is put away: but
they shall take maidens of the seede of the house of Israel, or a
widow that had a priest before.<note> Leuit. 21. 13. , Heb. thrust foorth. , Heb. from a priest.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">And they shall
teach my people the difference betweene the holy and prophane, and
cause men to discerne betweene the vncleane and the cleane.</ab>
<ab n="24">And in
controuersie they shall stand in iudgement, and they shall iudge it
according to my iudgements: and they shall keepe my lawes and my
statutes in all mine assemblies, and they shall halow my
Sabbaths.</ab>
<ab n="25">And they shall
come at no dead person to defile themselues: but for father or for
mother, or for sonne or for daughter, for brother or for sister,
that hath had no husband, they may defile themselues.<note> Leuit. 21. 1, 11.</note></ab>
<ab n="26">And after he is
cleansed, they shal reckon vnto him seuen dayes.</ab>
<ab n="27">And in the day
that he goeth into the sanctuarie, vnto the inner court to minister
in the sanctuarie, he shall offer his sinne offring, saith the Lord
God.</ab>
<ab n="28">And it shall be
vnto them for an inheritance; I am their inheritance: and yee shall
giue them no possession in Israel; I am their
possession.<note> Numb.18. 20. deut.10 9. and 18. 1,2. iosh.13 14,33.</note></ab>
<ab n="29">They shal eate
the meate offring, and the sinne offring, and the trespasse
offring, and euery dedicate thing in Israel shall be
theirs.<note> Or, deuoted.</note></ab>
<ab n="30">And the first of
all the first fruits of all things, and euery oblation of all of
euery sort of your oblations shall be the priests: yee shall also
giue vnto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the
blessing to rest in thine house.<note> Or, chiefe. , Exod. 13. 2. and 22. 29. and ver. 30. numb.3. 13. and 18. 12.</note></ab>
<ab n="31">The priests
shall not eate of any thing that is dead of it selfe or torne,
whether it be foule or beast.<note> Exod.22. 31. leuit.22 8.</note></ab>
