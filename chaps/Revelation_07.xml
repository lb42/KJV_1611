another Angel ascending from the East, hauing the seale of the
liuing God: and he cried with a loud voice to the foure Angels to
whom it was giuen to hurt the earth and the Sea,</ab>

not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till wee haue sealed
the seruants of our God in their foreheads.</ab>
