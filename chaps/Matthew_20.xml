<head>CHAP. XX.</head>
<head>1 Christ by the similitude of the
labourers in the vineyard, sheweth that God is debtor vnto no man:
17 Foretelleth his passion: 20 By answering the mother of Zebedeus
children, teacheth his disciples to be lowly: 30 and giueth two
blinde men their sight.</head>

<ab n="1">For the kingdome
of heauen is like vnto a man that is an housholder, which went out
early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.</ab>
<ab n="2">And when hee had
agreed with the labourers for a peny a day, he sent them into his
vineyard.<note> The Romane peny is the eight part of an ounce, which after fiue shillings the ounce, is seuen pence halfe peny.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And he went out
about the third houre, and saw others standing idle in the market
place,</ab>
<ab n="4">And said vnto
them, Go ye also into the vineyard, &amp; whatsoeuer is right, I
wil giue you. And they went their way.</ab>
<ab n="5">Againe he went
out about the sixth and ninth houre, and did likewise.</ab>

<fw>Labourers hired.</fw>
<ab n="6">And about the
eleuenth houre, he went out, and found others standing idle, and
saith vnto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?</ab>
<ab n="7">They say vnto
him, Because no man hath hired vs. He saith vnto them, Go ye also
into the vineyard: and whatsoeuer is right, that shall ye
receiue.</ab>
<ab n="8">So when euen was
come, the lord of the vineyard saith vnto his Steward, Call the
labourers, and giue them their hire, beginning from the last, vnto
the first.</ab>
<ab n="9">And when they
came that were hired about the eleuenth houre, they receiued euery
man a penie.</ab>
<ab n="10">But when the
first came, they supposed that they should haue receiued more, and
they likewise receiued euery man a penie.</ab>
<ab n="11">And when they
had receiued it, they murmured against the good man of the
house,</ab>
<ab n="12">Saying, These
last haue wrought but one houre, and thou hast made them equall
vnto vs, which haue borne the burden, and heat of the
day.<note> Or, haue continued one houre onely.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">But he answered
one of them and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou
agree with me for a penie?</ab>
<ab n="14">Take that thine
is, and goe thy way, I will giue vnto this last, euen as vnto
thee.</ab>
<ab n="15">Is it not
lawfull for mee to doe what I wil with mine owne? Is thine eye
euill, because I am good?</ab>
<ab n="16">So the last
shall be first, and the first last: for many bee called, but fewe
chosen.<note> Chap.19.30.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">¶ And Iesus
going vp to Hierusalem, tooke the twelue disciples apart in the
way, and said vnto them,<note> Mar.10.32. luke 18.31.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Behold, we goe
vp to Hierusalem, and the Sonne of man shall be betraied vnto the
chiefe Priests, and vnto the Scribes, and they shall condemne him
to death,</ab>
<ab n="19">And shal deliuer
him to the Gentiles to mocke, and to scourge, and to crucifie him:
and the third day he shall rise againe.<note> Ioh.18.32</note></ab>
<ab n="20">¶ Then came
to him the mother of Zebedees children, with her sonnes,
worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.<note> Mar.10.35.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">And he said vnto
her, What wilt thou? She saith vnto him, Grant, that these my two
sonnes may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the
left in thy kingdome.</ab>

<fw>Two blind men.</fw>
<ab n="22">But Iesus
answered, and said, Ye know not what ye aske. Are ye able to drinke
of the cup that I shall drinke of, and to be baptized with the
baptisme that I am baptized with? They say vnto him, We are
able.</ab>
<ab n="23">And he saith
vnto them, Yee shall drinke indeed of my cup, and be baptized with
the baptisme that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand,
and on my left, is not mine to giue, but it shall be giuen to them
for whom it is prepared of my father.</ab>
<ab n="24">And when the ten
heard it, they were moued with indignation against the two
brethren.</ab>
<ab n="25">But Iesus called
them vnto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles
exercise dominion ouer them, and they that are great, exercise
authoritie vpon them.<note> Luk. 22.25.</note></ab>
<ab n="26">But it shall not
be so among you: But whosoeuer will bee great among you, let him be
your minister.</ab>
<ab n="27">And whosoeuer
will be chiefe among you, let him be your seruant.</ab>
<ab n="28">Euen as the
Sonne of man came not to be ministred vnto, but minister, and to
giue his life a ransome for many.<note> Phil. 2.7.</note></ab>
<ab n="29">And as they
departed from Hiericho, a great multitude followed him.<note> Mar.10.46. luke 18.35.</note></ab>
<ab n="30">¶ And
behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that
Iesus passed by, cried out, saying, Haue mercie on vs, O Lord, thou
sonne of Dauid.</ab>
<ab n="31">And the
multitude rebuked them, because they should holde their peace: but
they cried the more, saying, Haue mercie on vs, O Lord, thou sonne
of Dauid.</ab>
<ab n="32">And Iesus stood
still, and called them, and saide, What will yee that I shall doe
vnto you?</ab>
<ab n="33">They say vnto
him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</ab>
<ab n="34">So Iesus had
compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediatly their
eyes receiued sight, and they followed him.</ab>
