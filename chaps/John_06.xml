<head>CHAP. VI.</head>
<head>1 Christ feedeth fiue thousand men
with fiue loaues and two fishes. 15 Thereupon the people would haue
made him King. 16 But withdrawing himselfe, he walked on the sea to
his disciples: 26 Reprooueth the people flocking after him, and all
the fleshly hearers of his word: 32 Declareth himselfe to be the
Bread of life to beleeuers. 66 Many disciples depart from him. 68
Peter confesseth him. 70 Iudas is a deuil.</head>

<ab n="1">After these
things Iesus went ouer the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of
Tiberias:</ab>
<ab n="2">And a great
multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which hee did
on them that were diseased.</ab>
<ab n="3">And Iesus went
vp into a mountaine, and there hee sate with his disciples.</ab>
<ab n="4">And the
Passeouer, a feast of the Iewes, was nigh.<note> Leuit.23. 5. deut.16. 1.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">¶ When
Iesus then lift vp his eyes, and saw a great company come vnto him,
he saith vnto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may
eate?<note> Matt. 14. 15.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">(And this he
said to proue him: for he himselfe knew what he would doe)</ab>
<ab n="7">Philip answered
him, Two hundred peny-worth of bread is not sufficient for them,
that euery one of them may take a litle.</ab>
<ab n="8">One of his
disciples, Andrew, Simon Peters brother, saith vnto him,</ab>
<ab n="9">There is a lad
here, which hath fiue barley loaues, and two small fishes: but what
are they among so many?</ab>
<ab n="10">And Iesus
said, Make the men sit downe. Now there was much grasse in the
place. So the men sate downe, in number about fiue
thousand.</ab>
<ab n="11">And Iesus
tooke the loaues, and when he had giuen thankes, hee distributed to
the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set downe, and
likewise of the fishes, as much as they would.</ab>
<ab n="12">When they were
filled, he said vnto his disciples, Gather vp the fragments that
remaine, that nothing be lost.</ab>
<ab n="13">Therefore they
gathered them together, and filled twelue baskets with the
fragments of the fiue barley loaues, which remained ouer and aboue,
vnto them that had eaten.</ab>

<fw>Meat that perisheth.</fw>
<ab n="14">Then those
men, when they had seene the miracle that Iesus did, said, This is
of a trueth that Prophet that should come into the world.</ab>
<ab n="15">¶ When
Iesus therefore perceiued that they would come and take him by
force, to make him a King, hee departed againe into a mountaine,
himselfe alone.</ab>
<ab n="16">And when euen
was now come, his disciples went downe vnto the sea,<note> Matth.14. 23.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">And entred
into a ship, and went ouer the sea towards Capernaum: and it was
now darke, and Iesus was not come to them.</ab>
<ab n="18">And the sea
arose, by reason of a great winde that blew.</ab>
<ab n="19">So when they
had rowed about fiue and twentie, or thirtie furlongs, they see
Iesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh vnto the ship: and they
were afraid.</ab>
<ab n="20">But he saith
vnto them, It is I, be not afraid.</ab>
<ab n="21">Then they
willingly receiued him into the ship, and immediatly the ship was
at the land whither they went.</ab>
<ab n="22">¶ The day
following, when the people which stood on the other side of the
sea, saw that there was none other boat there, saue that one
whereinto his disciples were entred, and that Iesus went not with
his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away
alone:</ab>
<ab n="23">Howbeit there
came other boats from Tiberias, nigh vnto the place where they did
eate bread, after that the Lord had giuen thankes:</ab>
<ab n="24">When the
people therefore saw that Iesus was not there, neither his
disciples, they also tooke shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking
for Iesus.</ab>
<ab n="25">And when they
had found him on the other side of the sea, they saide vnto him,
Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</ab>
<ab n="26">Iesus answered
them, and said, Uerely, verely I say vnto you, Ye seeke me, not
because ye saw the miracles, but because yee did eate of the
loaues, and were filled.</ab>
<ab n="27">Labour not for
the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth vnto
euerlasting life, which the Sonne of man shall giue vnto you: for
him hath God the Father sealed.<note> Or, worke not. , Matth.3. 17.</note></ab>

<fw>Christ is the bread of life.</fw>
<ab n="28">Then said they
vnto him, What shall we doe, that we might worke the workes of
God?</ab>
<ab n="29">Iesus
answered, and said vnto them, This is the worke of God, that ye
beleeue on him whom he hath sent.<note> 1.Ioh.3. 13.</note></ab>
<ab n="30">They said
therefore vnto him, What signe shewest thou then, that we may see,
and beleeue thee? What doest thou worke?</ab>
<ab n="31">Our fathers
did eate Manna in the desert, as it is written, He gaue them bread
from heauen to eate.<note> Exod.16. 15. numb. 11.7. , Psal.78. 25.</note></ab>
<ab n="32">Then Iesus
said vnto them, Uerely, verely I say vnto you, Moses gaue you not
that bread from heauen, but my Father giueth you the true bread
from heauen.</ab>
<ab n="33">For the bread
of God is hee which commeth downe from heauen, and giueth life vnto
the world.</ab>
<ab n="34">Then said they
vnto him, Lord, euermore giue vs this bread.</ab>
<ab n="35">And Iesus said
vnto them, I am the bread of life: hee that commeth to me, shall
neuer hunger: and he that beleeueth on me, shall neuer
thirst.</ab>
<ab n="36">But I said
vnto you, that ye also haue seene me, and beleeue not.</ab>
<ab n="37">All that the
Father giueth mee, shall come to mee; and him that commeth to me, I
will in no wise cast out.</ab>
<ab n="38">For I came
downe from heauen, not to doe mine owne will, but the will of him
that sent me.</ab>
<ab n="39">And this is
the Fathers wil which hath sent me, that of all which he hath giuen
mee, I should lose nothing, but should raise it vp againe at the
last day.</ab>
<ab n="40">And this is
the will of him that sent me, that euery one which seeth the Sonne,
and beleeueth on him, may haue euerlasting life: and I will raise
him vp at the last day.</ab>
<ab n="41">The Iewes then
murmured at him, because hee said, I am the bread which came downe
from heauen.</ab>
<ab n="42">And they said,
Is not this Iesus the sonne of Ioseph, whose father and mother we
know? How is it then that hee sayth, I came downe from
heauen?<note> Mat.13. 55.</note></ab>
<ab n="43">Iesus
therefore answered, and said vnto them, Murmure not among your
selues.</ab>
<ab n="44">No man can
come to me, except the Father which hath sent me, draw him: and I
will raise him vp at the last day.</ab>

<fw>Christ is the bread of life.</fw>
<ab n="45">It is written
in the Prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Euery man
therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, commeth
vnto me,<note> Esai 54. 13. iere. 31.34.</note></ab>
<ab n="46">Not that any
man hath seene the Father; saue hee which is of God, hee hath seene
the Father.<note> Mat.11. 27.</note></ab>
<ab n="47">Uerely, verely
I say vnto you, Hee that beleeueth on me, hath euerlasting
life.</ab>
<ab n="48">I am that
bread of life.</ab>
<ab n="49">Your fathers
did eate Manna in the wildernesse, and are dead.</ab>
<ab n="50">This is the
bread which commeth downe from heauen, that a man may eate thereof,
and not die.</ab>
<ab n="51">I am the
liuing bread, which came downe from heauen. If any man eate of this
bread, he shall liue for euer: and the bread that I will giue, is
my flesh, which I will giue for the life of the world.</ab>
<ab n="52">The Iewes
therefore stroue amongst themselues, saying, How can this man giue
vs his flesh to eate?</ab>
<ab n="53">Then Iesus
sayd vnto them, Uerely, verely I say vnto you, Except yee eate the
flesh of the sonne of man, and drinke his blood, yee haue no life
in you.</ab>
<ab n="54">Whoso eateth
my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternall life, and I will
raise him vp at the last day.</ab>
<ab n="55">For my flesh
is meate indeed, and my blood is drinke indeed.</ab>
<ab n="56">He that eateth
my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in
him.</ab>
<ab n="57">As the liuing
Father hath sent me, and I liue by the Father: so, he that eateth
me, euen he shall liue by me.</ab>
<ab n="58">This is that
bread which came downe from heauen: not as your fathers did eate
Manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread, shall liue for
euer.</ab>
<ab n="59">These things
said hee in the Synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</ab>
<ab n="60">Many therefore
of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard
saying, who can heare it?</ab>
<ab n="61">When Iesus
knew in himselfe, that his disciples murmured at it, hee said vnto
them, Doeth this offend you?</ab>
<ab n="62">What and if
yee shall see the sonne of man ascend vp where hee was
before?<note> Cha.3.13.</note></ab>

<fw>Iudas a deuill.</fw>
<ab n="63">It is the
Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing: the wordes
that I speake vnto you, they are Spirit, and they are life.</ab>
<ab n="64">But there are
some of you that beleeue not. For Iesus knew from the beginning,
who they were that beleeued not, and who should betray him.</ab>
<ab n="65">And he said,
Therefore said I vnto you, that no man can come vnto me, except it
were giuen vnto him of my Father.</ab>
<ab n="66">¶ From
that time many of his disciples went backe, and walked no more with
him.</ab>
<ab n="67">Then said
Iesus vnto the twelue, Will ye also goe away?</ab>
<ab n="68">Then Simon
Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we goe? Thou hast the words
of eternall life.</ab>
<ab n="69">And we beleeue
and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Sonne of the liuing
God.<note> Matth.16 16.</note></ab>
<ab n="70">Iesus answered
them, Haue not I chosen you twelue, and one of you is a
deuill?</ab>
<ab n="71">He spake of
Iudas Iscariot the sonne of Simon: for hee it was that should
betray him, being one of the twelue.</ab>
