<head>CHAP.
XXIII.</head>
<head>1 Christ admonisheth the people to
follow the good doctrine, not the euill examples of the Scribes and
Pharises. 5 His disciples must beware of their ambition. 13 Hee
denounceth eight woes against their hypocrisie and blindnesse: 34
and prophecieth of the destruction of Hierusalem.</head>


<fw>Against ambition, and
hypocrisie.</fw>
<ab n="1">Then spake Iesus
to the multitude, and to his disciples,</ab>
<ab n="2">Saying, The
Scribes and the Pharises sit in Moses seate:</ab>
<ab n="3">All therefore
whatsoeuer they bid you obserue, that obserue and doe, but doe not
ye after their workes: for they say, and doe not.</ab>
<ab n="4">For they binde
heauie burdens, and grieuous to be borne, and lay them on mens
shoulders, but they themselues will not mooue them with one of
their fingers.<note> Luk.11.46</note></ab>
<ab n="5">But all their
workes they doe, for to be seene of men: they make broad their
phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their
garments,<note> Num.15.38. deut. 22.12.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">And loue the
vppermost roomes at feasts, and the chiefe seats in the
Synagogues,<note> Mark. 12.38. luke. 11.43.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">And greetings in
the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.</ab>
<ab n="8">But be not ye
called Rabbi: for one is your Master, euen Christ, and all ye are
brethren.<note> Iames 3.1</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And call no man
your father vpon the earth: for one is your father which is in
heauen.<note> Mala. 1.6.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">Neither be ye
called masters: for one is your Master, euen Christ.</ab>
<ab n="11">But hee that is
greatest among you, shall be your seruant.</ab>
<ab n="12">And whosoeuer
shall exalt himselfe, shall be abased: and he that shall humble
himselfe, shall be exalted.<note> Luk.14.11 and 18.14.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">¶ But woe
vnto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for yee shut vp the
kingdom of heauen against men: For yee neither goe in your selues,
neither suffer ye them that are entring, to goe in.<note> Luk. 11.52.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">Woe vnto you
Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for yee deuoure widowes houses,
and for a pretence make long prayer; therefore ye shall receiue the
greater damnation.<note> Mar. 12.40. luk.20.47.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">Woe vnto you
Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites; for yee compasse Sea and land to
make one Proselyte, and when hee is made, yee make him two fold
more the childe of hell then your selues.</ab>
<ab n="16">Woe vnto you,
yee blind guides, which say, Whosoeuer shall sweare by the Temple,
it is nothing: but whosoeuer shal sweare by the gold of the Temple,
he is a debter.</ab>

<fw>Against ambition, and
hypocrisie.</fw>
<ab n="17">Ye fooles and
blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the Temple that
sanctifieth the gold?</ab>
<ab n="18">And whosoeuer
shall sweare by the Altar, it is nothing: but whosoeuer sweareth by
the gift that is vpon it, he is guiltie.<note> Or, a debter, or bound</note></ab>
<ab n="19">Ye fooles and
blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the Altar that
sanctifieth the gift?</ab>
<ab n="20">Who so therefore
shall sweare by the Altar, sweareth by it, and by all things
thereon.</ab>
<ab n="21">And who so shall
sweare by the Temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth
therein.</ab>
<ab n="22">And he that
shall sweare by heauen, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him
that sitteth thereon.</ab>
<ab n="23">Woe vnto you
Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for yee pay tithe of mint, and
annise, and cummine, and haue omitted the weightier matters of the
Law, iudgement, mercie and faith: these ought ye to haue done, and
not to leaue the other vndone.<note> Luk. 11.42</note></ab>
<ab n="24">Ye blind guides,
which straine at a gnat, and swallow a camel.</ab>
<ab n="25">Woe vnto you
Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for yee make cleane the outside
of the cup, and of the platter, but within they are full of
extortion and excesse.<note> Luk 11.39</note></ab>
<ab n="26">Thou blind
Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter,
that the outside of them may bee cleane also.</ab>
<ab n="27">Woe vnto you
Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for yee are like vnto whited
sepulchres, which indeed appeare beautifull outward, but are within
full of dead mens bones, and of all vncleannesse.</ab>
<ab n="28">Euen so, yee
also outwardly appeare righteous vnto men, but within ye are full
of hypocrisie and iniquitie.</ab>
<ab n="29">Woe vnto you
Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because ye build the tombes of
the Prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,</ab>
<ab n="30">And say, If wee
had beene in the dayes of our fathers, wee would not haue bene
partakers with them in the blood of the Prophets.</ab>
<ab n="31">Wherefore ye bee
witnesses vnto your selues, that yee are the children of them which
killed the Prophets.</ab>
<ab n="32">Fil ye vp then
the measure of your fathers.</ab>

<fw>Of persecution, and
afflictions.</fw>
<ab n="33">Yee serpents,
yee generation of vipers, How can yee escape the damnation of
hell?</ab>
<ab n="34">¶ Wherefore
behold, I send vnto you Prophets, and wisemen, and Scribes, and
some of them yee shall kill and crucifie, and some of them shall
yee scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from citie to
citie:</ab>
<ab n="35">That vpon you
may come all the righteous blood shed vpon the earth, from the
blood of righteous Abel, vnto the blood of Zacharias, sonne of
Barachias, whom yee slew betweene the temple and the
altar.<note> Gen.4.8.</note></ab>
<ab n="36">Uerily I say
vnto you, All these things shal come vpon this generation.</ab>
<ab n="37">O Hierusalem,
Hierusalem, thou that killest the Prophets, and stonest them which
are sent vnto thee, how often would I haue gathered thy children
together, euen as a hen gathereth her chickens vnder her wings, and
yee would not?<note> Luke 13.34. , 2.Chro. 24.21. , 4. Esd. 1.30.</note></ab>
<ab n="38">Behold, your
house is left vnto you desolate.</ab>
<ab n="39">For I say vnto
you, yee shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is
he that commeth in the Name of the Lord.</ab>
