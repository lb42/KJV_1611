<ab n="1">Likewise this is
the lawe of the trespasse offering: it is most holy.</ab>
<ab n="2">In the place
where they kil the burnt offring, shall they kil the trespasse
offering; and the blood thereof shall hee sprinckle round about
vpon the Altar.</ab>
<ab n="3">And he shall
offer of it, all the fat thereof; the rumpe, and the fat that
couereth the inwards,</ab>
<ab n="4">And the two
kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flankes, and
the caule that is aboue the liuer, with the kidneys, it shall he
take away.</ab>
<ab n="5">And the Priest
shall burne them vpon the Altar, for an offering made by fire vnto
the Lord: it is a trespasse offering.</ab>
<ab n="6">Euery male among
the Priestes shall eate thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy
place: it is most holy.</ab>

<fw>The eating of blood is
forbidden.</fw>
<ab n="7">As the sinne
offering is, so is the trespasse offering: there is one law for
them: the Priest that maketh atonement therewith, shall haue
it.</ab>
<ab n="8">And the Priest
that offereth any mans burnt offering, euen the Priest shall haue
to himselfe the skinne of the burnt offering which he hath
offered.</ab>
<ab n="9">And all the
meate offering that is baken in the ouen, and all that is dressed
in the frying panne, and in the panne, shall be the Priests that
offereth it.<note> Or, on the flat plate, or, slice.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">And euery meate
offering mingled with oyle, and drie, shall all the sonnes of Aaron
haue, one as much as another.</ab>
<ab n="11">And this is the
law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer vnto
the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="12">If hee offer it
for a thankesgiuing, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of
thankesgiuing vnleauened cakes mingled with oyle, and vnleauened
wafers anointed with oile, and cakes mingled with oyle of fine
flowre fried.</ab>
<ab n="13">Besides the
cakes, hee shall offer for his offring leauened bread, with the
sacrifice of thankesgiuing of his peace offerings.</ab>
<ab n="14">And of it he
shall offer one out of the whole oblation, for an heaue offering
vnto the Lord, and it shall bee the Priests that sprinkleth the
blood of the peace offerings.</ab>
<ab n="15">And the flesh
of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thankesgiuing, shall be
eaten the same day that it is offered: he shall not leaue any of it
vntill the morning.</ab>
<ab n="16">But if the
sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it
shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on
the morrowe also the remainder of it shall be eaten.</ab>
<ab n="17">But the
remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall bee
burnt with fire.</ab>
<ab n="18">And if any of
the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all
on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shal it be
imputed vnto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and
the soule that eateth of it, shall beare his iniquitie.</ab>
<ab n="19">And the flesh
that toucheth any vncleane thing, shal not be eaten: it shal be
burnt with fire, and as for the flesh, all that be cleane shall
eate thereof.</ab>

<fw>The eating of blood is
forbidden.</fw>
<ab n="20">But the soule
that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that

soule shall be cut off from his people.<note> Chap. 15. 3.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">Moreouer, the
soule that shall touch any vncleane thing, as the vncleannesse of
man, or any vncleane beast, or any abominable vncleane thing, and
eate of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings which
pertaine vnto the Lord, euen that soule shall be cut off from his
people.</ab>
<ab n="22">¶ And the
Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,</ab>
<ab n="23">Speake vnto the
children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no maner fat of oxe, or of
sheepe, or of goat.<note> Chap.3. 17.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">And the fat of
the beast that dieth of it selfe, and the fat of that which is

no wise eate of it.<note> Heb. carcaise.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">For whosoeuer
eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offring made by

from his people.</ab>
<ab n="26">Moreouer ye
shall eat no maner of blood, whether it bee of foule or of beast in
any of your dwellings.<note> Gene.9. 4 chap.3. 17. and 17.14.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">Whatsoeuer
soule it be that eateth any maner of blood, euen that soule shalbe
cut off from his people.</ab>
<ab n="28">¶ And the
Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,</ab>
<ab n="29">Speake vnto the
children of Israel, saying, Hee that offereth the sacrifice of his
peace offerings vnto the Lord, shall bring his oblation vnto the
Lord, of the sacrifice of his peaceofferings.</ab>
<ab n="30">His owne hands
shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire, the fat with
the brest, it shall hee bring, that the brest may be waued for a
waue offering before the Lord.<note> Exod. 29. 24.</note></ab>
<ab n="31">And the Priest
shall burne the fat vpon the Altar: but the brest shalbe Aarons and
his sonnes.</ab>
<ab n="32">And the right
shoulder shall ye giue vnto the Priest for an heaue offering of the
sacrifices of your peace offerings.</ab>
<ab n="33">Hee among the
sonnes of Aaron that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and
the fat, shall haue the right shoulder for his part.</ab>

<fw>The consecration of Aaron, and of his
sonnes.</fw>
<ab n="34">For the waue
brest and the heaue shoulder haue I taken of the children of
Israel, from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and haue
giuen them vnto Aaron the Priest, and vnto his sonnes, by a statute
for euer, from among the children of Israel.</ab>
<ab n="35">¶ This is
the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his
sonnes, out of the offerings of the Lord made by fire, in the day
when he presented them, to minister vnto the Lord in the Priests
office:</ab>
<ab n="36">Which the Lord
commanded to be giuen them of the children of Israel, in the day
that hee anointed them, by a statute for euer, throughout their
generations.</ab>
<ab n="37">This is the law
of the burnt offering, of the meate offering, and of the sinne
offering, and of the trespasse offering, and of the consecrations,
and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings:</ab>
<ab n="38">Which the Lord
commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the
children of Israel to offer their oblations vnto the Lord, in the
wildernesse of Sinai.</ab>
