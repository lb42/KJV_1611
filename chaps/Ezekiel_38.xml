<head>1 The armie, 8 and malice of Gog. 14
Gods iudgement against him.</head>

<ab n="1">And the word of
þ<note/> Lord came vnto me, saying;</ab>
<ab n="2">Sonne of man, set
thy face against Gog, the land of Magog the chiefe prince of
Meshech and Tubal, and prophecie against him,<note> Reu. 20.8. , Or prince of the chiefe.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And say, Thus
saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chiefe
prince of Meshech and Tubal.</ab>
<ab n="4">And I will turne
thee backe, and put hookes into thy chawes, and I will bring thee
foorth, and all thine armie, horses and horsemen, all of them
clothed with all sorts of armour, euen a great company with
bucklers &amp; shields, all of them handling swordes.<note> Cha. 39.2.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">Persia, Ethiopia
and Libya with them; all of them with shield &amp;
helmet:<note> Or. Phut.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">Gomer and all his
bandes, the house of Togarmah of the North quarters, and all his
bands, and many people with thee.</ab>

<fw>Against Gog, and Magog.</fw>
<ab n="7">Be thou prepared,
and prepare for thy selfe, thou and all thy company, that are
assembled vnto thee, and be thou a guard vnto them.</ab>
<ab n="8">¶ After many
daies thou shalt be visited: in the latter yeeres thou shalt come
into the land, that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered
out of many people against the mountaines of Israel, which haue
beene alwayes waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations,
and they shall dwell safely all of them.</ab>
<ab n="9">Thou shalt ascend
and come like a storme, thou shalt be like a cloud to couer the
land, thou and all thy bands, and many people with thee.</ab>
<ab n="10">Thus saith the
Lord God; It shall also come to passe, that at the same time shall
things come into thy minde, and thou shalt thinke an euill
thought.<note> Or, conceiue a mischieuous purpose.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And thou shalt
say: I will goe vp to the land of vnwalled villages; I will goe to
them that are at rest, that dwell safely all of them dwelling
without walles, and hauing neither barres nor gates;<note> Or, confidently.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">To take a
spoile, and to take a praye, to turne thine hand vpon the desolate
places that are now inhabited, and vpon the people that are
gathered out of the nations which haue gotten cattel and goods,
that dwell in the middest of the land.<note> Heb. to spoile the spoile, and to praye the praye. , Heb. nauell.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Sheba, and
Dedan, and the marchants of Tarshish, with all the young lyons
thereof, shall say vnto thee, Art thou come to take a spoile? hast
thou gathered thy company to take a praye? to carie away siluer and
gold, to take away cattell and goods, to take a great
spoile?</ab>
<ab n="14">¶
Therefore, sonne of man, prophecie and say vnto Gog, Thus saith the
Lord God; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely,
shalt thou not know it?</ab>
<ab n="15">And thou shalt
come from thy place out of the North parts, thou and many people
with thee, all of them riding vpon horses, a great company, and a
mighty armie.</ab>
<ab n="16">And thou shalt
come vp against my people of Israel, as a cloud to couer the land;
it shall be in the latter dayes, and I will bring thee against my
land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in
thee, O Gog, before their eyes.</ab>

<fw>Against Gog, and Magog.</fw>
<ab n="17">Thus saith the
Lord God; Art thou hee, of whom I haue spoken in old time by my
seruants the prophets of Israel, which prophecied in those dayes
many yeeres, that I would bring thee against them?<note> Heb. by the hands.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">And it shall
come to passe at the same time, when Gog shal come against the land
of Israel, saith the Lord God, that my furie shall come vp in my
face.</ab>
<ab n="19">For in my
iealousie, and in the fire of my wrath haue I spoken: surely in
that day, there shall be a great shaking in the land of
Israel.</ab>
<ab n="20">So that the
fishes of the sea, and the foules of the heauen, and the beasts of
the field, and all creeping things that creepe vpon the earth, and
all the men that are vpon the face of the earth, shall shake at my
presence, and the mountaines shall be throwen downe, and the steepe
places shall fall, and euery wall shall fall to the
ground.<note> Or, towres. Or staires.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">And I will call
for a sword against him throughout all my mountaines, saith the
Lord God: euery mans sword shalbe against his brother.</ab>
<ab n="22">And I will plead
against him with pestilence and with blood, and I will raine vpon
him and vpon his bands, and vpon the many people that are with him,
an ouerflowing raine, and great hailestones, fire, and
brimstone.</ab>
<ab n="23">Thus will I
magnifie my selfe, and sanctifie my selfe, and I will be knowen in
the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the
Lord.<note> Chap.36. 23. and 37. 28.</note></ab>
