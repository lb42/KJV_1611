<ab n="5">For this cause
left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things
that are wanting, and ordaine Elders in euery citie, as I had
appointed thee.<note> Or, left vndone.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">If any be
blamelesse, the husband of one wife, hauing faithfull children, not
accused of riot, or vnruly.</ab>
<ab n="7">For a Bishop
must be blameles, as the steward of God: not selfewilled, not soone

ought not, for filthie lucres sake.</ab>

<fw>Old mens dueties.</fw>
<ab n="12">One of themselues,
euen a Prophet of their owne, said: The Cretians are alway lyers,
euill beasts, slow bellies.</ab>
<ab n="13">This witnesse is
true: wherefore rebuke them sharpely that they may be sound in the
faith;</ab>
<ab n="14">Not giuing heede to
Iewish fables, and commandements of men that turne from the
trueth.</ab>
<ab n="15">Unto the pure all
things are pure, but vnto them that are defiled, and vnbeleeuing,
is nothing pure: but euen their mind and conscience is
defiled.</ab>
<ab n="16">They professe that
they know God; but in workes they deny him, being abominable, and
disobedient, and vnto euery good worke reprobate.<note> Or, voide of iudgment.</note></ab>
