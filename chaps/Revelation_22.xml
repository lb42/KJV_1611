<head>CHAP.
XXII.</head>
<head>1 The riuer of the water of life. 2
The tree of life. 5 The light of the Citie of God is himselfe. 9
The Angel wil not be worshipped. 18 Nothing may be added to the
word of God, nor taken therefrom.</head>

<ab n="1">And he shewed
mee a pure riuer of water of life, cleere as Chrystall, proceeding
out of the throne of God, and of the Lambe.</ab>
<ab n="2">In the middest
of the street of it, and of either side of the riuer, was there the
tree of life, which bare twelue manner of fruits, and yeelded her
fruit euery moneth: and the leaues of the tree were for the healing
of the nations.</ab>
<ab n="3">And there
shall be no more curse, but the throne of God, &amp; of the Lambe
shall bee in it, and his seruants shall serue him.</ab>
<ab n="4">And they shall
see his face, and his Name shall be in their foreheads.</ab>
<ab n="5">And there
shalbe no night there, and they need no candle, neither light of
the Sunne, for the Lord God giueth them light, and they shall
reigne for euer and euer.<note> Chap.21. 23.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">And hee said
vnto mee, These sayings are faithfull and true. And the Lord God of
the holy Prophets sent his Angel to shew vnto his seruants the
things which must shortly be done.</ab>
<ab n="7">Beholde, I
come quickly: Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the
prophecie of this booke.</ab>

<fw>The water of life is offered
freely.</fw>
<ab n="8">And I Iohn saw
these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seene, I
fell downe, to worship before the feete of the Angel, which shewed
me these things.</ab>
<ab n="9">Then saith he
vnto me, See thou doe it not: for I am thy fellow seruant, and of
thy brethren the Prophets, and of them which keepe the sayings of
this booke: worship God.<note> Chap.19. 10.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">And hee saith
vnto mee, Seale not the sayings of the prophesie of this booke: for
the time is at hand.</ab>
<ab n="11">He that is
vniust, let him be vniust still: and he which is filthy, let him be
filthy still: and hee that is righteous, let him bee righteous
still: and hee that is holy, let him be holy still.</ab>
<ab n="12">And behold, I
come quickly, and my reward is with mee, to giue euery man
according as his worke shall be.<note> Rom.2.6.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">I am Alpha
and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first &amp; the
last.<note> Esa.41.4. and 44.6.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">Blessed are
they that do his commandements, that they may haue right to the
tree of life, and may enter in thorow the gates into the
citie.</ab>
<ab n="15">For without
are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and
idolaters, and whosoeuer loueth and maketh a lie.</ab>
<ab n="16">I Iesus haue
sent mine Angel, to testifie vnto you these things in the Churches.
I am the roote and the offspring of Dauid, and the bright and
morning starre.</ab>
<ab n="17">And the
Spirit and the Bride say, Come. And let him that heareth, say,
Come. And let him that is a thirst, come. And whosoeuer will, let
him take the water of life freely.<note> Esai.55.1.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">For I
testifie vnto euery man that heareth the wordes of the prophesie of
this booke, If any man shal adde vnto these things, God shall adde
vnto him the plagues, that are written in this booke.<note> Deut.4.2. prou. 30.6.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">And if any
man shall take away from the wordes of the booke of this prophesie,
God shal take away his part out of the booke of life, and out of
the holy citie, and from the things which are written in this
booke.</ab>
<ab n="20">Hee which
testifieth these things, saith, Surely, I come quickly. Amen. Euen
so, Come Lord Iesus.</ab>
<ab n="21">The grace of
our Lord Iesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</ab>
