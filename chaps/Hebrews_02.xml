<head>CHAP. II.</head>
<head>1 Wee ought to bee obedient to
Christ Iesus, 5 and that because he vouchsafed to take our nature
vpon him, 14 as it was necessarie.</head>

<ab n="1">Therefore we ought
to giue the more earnest heede to the things which we haue heard,
lest at any time we should let them slip.<note> Gr. run out as leaking vessels.</note></ab>

<fw>Christ made like to vs.</fw>
<ab n="2">For if the word
spoken by Angels was stedfast, and euery transgression and
disobedience receiued a iust recompense of reward:</ab>
<ab n="3">How shall we
escape, if we neglect so great saluation, which at the first began
to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed vnto vs by them that
heard him,</ab>
<ab n="4">God also bearing
them witnesse, both with signes &amp; wonders, and with diuers
miracles, and gifts of the holy Ghost, according to his owne
will?<note> Or, distributions.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">For vnto the
Angels hath he not put in subiection the world to come, whereof we
speake.</ab>
<ab n="6">But one in a
certaine place testified, saying: What is man, that thou art
mindfull of him: or the Sonne of man that thou visitest
him?<note> Psal.8.4.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">Thou madest him a
little lower then the Angels, thou crownedst him with glory and
honor, and didst set him ouer the workes of thy hands.<note> Or, a little while inferiour to.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Thou hast put all
things in subiection vnder his feete. For in that he put all in
subiection vnder him, hee left nothing that is not put vnder him.
But now wee see not yet all things put vnder him.</ab>
<ab n="9">But wee see Iesus,
who was made a little lower then the Angels, for the suffering of
death, crowned with glory and honour, that hee by the grace of God
should taste death for euery man.<note> Or, by.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">For it became
him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in
bringing many sonnes vnto glory, to make the Captaine of their
saluation perfect through sufferings.</ab>
<ab n="11">For both hee that
sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one: for which
cause he is not ashamed to cal them brethren,</ab>
<ab n="12">Saying, I will
declare thy Name vnto my brethren, in the midst of the Church will
I sing praise vnto thee.</ab>
<ab n="13">And againe, I
will put my trust in him: and againe, Behold, I, and the children
which God hath giuen me.<note> Psal.18.2. , Esay 8.18.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">Forasmuch then as
the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himselfe
likewise took part of the same, that through death hee might
destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the
deuill:</ab>

<fw>Christ made like to vs.</fw>
<ab n="15">And deliuer them,
who through feare of death were all their life time subiect to
bondage.</ab>
<ab n="16">For verely he
tooke not on him the nature of Angels: but he tooke on him the seed
of Abraham.<note> Gr. hee taketh not hold of Angels, but of the seede of Abraham he taketh hold.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">Wherfore in all
things it behooued him to bee made like vnto his brethren, that he
might be a mercifull and faithfull high Priest, in things
pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sinnes of the
people.</ab>
<ab n="18">For in that he
himselfe hath suffered, being tempted, he is able to succour them
that are tempted.</ab>
