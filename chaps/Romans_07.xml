<head>CHAP.
VII.</head>
<head>1 No law hath power ouer a man,
longer then hee liueth. 4 But wee are dead to the law. 7 Yet is not
the law sinne, 12 but holy, iust, good, 16 as I acknowledge, who am
grieued because I cannot keepe it.</head>

<ab n="1">Know ye not,
brethren (for I speake to them that knowe the Lawe) how that the
Lawe hath dominion ouer a man, as long as he liueth?</ab>
<ab n="2">For the woman
which hath an husbaud, is bound by the law to her husband, so long
as he liueth: but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the
law of the husband.</ab>
<ab n="3">So then if
while her husband liueth, shee be married to another man, shee
shalbe called an adulteresse: but if her husband be dead, shee is
free from that law, so that she is no adulteresse, though she be
married to another man.</ab>

<fw>Mans weakenes.</fw>
<ab n="4">Wherefore my
brethren, yee also are become dead to the law by the body of
Christ, that ye should be married to another, euen to him who is
raised from the dead, that wee should bring forth fruit vnto
God,</ab>
<ab n="5">For when wee
were in the flesh, the motions of sinnes which were by the law, did
worke in our members, to bring foorth fruit vnto death.<note> Gr. passions</note></ab>
<ab n="6">But now wee
are deliuered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held,
that we should serue in newnesse of spirit, and not in the oldnesse
of the letter.<note> Or, being dead to that.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">What shall
wee say then? is the law sinne? God forbid. Nay, I had not knowen
sinne, but by the lawe: for I had not knowen lust, except the Law
had said, Thou shalt not couet.<note> Or, concupiscence.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">But sinne
taking occasion by the commaundement, wrought in me all maner of
concupiscence. For without the Law sinne was dead.</ab>
<ab n="9">For I was
aliue without the Law once, but when the commandement came, sinne
reuiued, and I died.</ab>
<ab n="10">And the
commandement which was ordained to life, I found to be vnto
death.</ab>
<ab n="11">For sinne taking
occasion by the commandement, deceiued me, and by it slew
me.</ab>
<ab n="12">Wherefore the Law
is holy, and the Commandement holy, and iust, and good.</ab>
<ab n="13">Was that then
which is good, made death vnto me? God forbid. But sinne, that it
might appeare sinne, working death in mee by that which is good:
that sinne by the Commaundement might become exceeding
sinfull.</ab>
<ab n="14">For wee know that
the Law is spirituall: but I am carnall, sold vnder sinne.</ab>
<ab n="15">For that which I
do, I allow not: for what I would, that do I not, but what I hate,
that doe I.<note> Gr. know.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">If then I doe that
which I would not, I consent vnto the Law, that it is good.</ab>
<ab n="17">Now then, it is no
more I that doe it: but sinne that dwelleth in me.</ab>
<ab n="18">For I know, that
in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing. For to will is
present with me: but how to performe that which is good, I find
not.</ab>

<fw>Flesh and spirit.</fw>
<ab n="19">For the good that
I would, I do not: but the euill which I would not, that I
doe.</ab>
<ab n="20">Now if I doe that
I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sinne that dwelleth in
me.</ab>
<ab n="21">I find then a Law,
that when I would do good, euil is present with me.</ab>
<ab n="22">For I delight in
the Lawe of God, after the inward man.</ab>
<ab n="23">But I see another
Lawe in my members, warring against the Lawe of my minde, and
bringing me into captiuity to the Law of sinne, which is in my
members.</ab>
<ab n="24">O wretched man
that I am: who shall deliuer me from the body of this
death?<note> Or, this body of death.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">I thanke God
through Iesus Christ our Lord. So then, with the mind I my self
serue the Law of God: but with the flesh, the law of sinne.</ab>
