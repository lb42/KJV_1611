<head>CHAP. XI.</head>
<head>1 Ieremiah proclaimeth Gods
Couenant: 8 Rebuketh the Iewes disobeying thereof: 11 Prophesieth
euils to come vpon them, 18 and vpon the men of Anathoth, for
conspiring to kill Ieremiah.</head>


<fw>Obey the Couenant.</fw>
<ab n="1">The word that
came to Ieremiah from the Lord, saying,</ab>
<ab n="2">Heare yee the
words of this Couenant, and speake vnto the men of Iudah, and to
the inhabitants of Ierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="3">And say thou
vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Cursed bee the man
that obeyeth not the words of this Couenant,<note> Deut. 27. 26. gal.3. 10.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">Which I
commaunded your fathers in the day that I brought them foorth out
of the land of Egypt, from the yron furnace, saying, Obey my voyce,
and doe them, according to all which I command you: so shall yee be
my people, and I will be your God.<note> Leuit. 26. 3, 12.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">That I may
performe the othe which I haue sworne vnto your fathers, to giue
them a land flowing with milke and honie, as it is this day: then
answered I, and said, So bee it, O Lord.<note> Deut.7. 12. , Hebr. Amen.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">Then the Lord
said vnto me, Proclaime all these wordes in the cities of Iudah,
and in the streets of Ierusalem, saying, Heare ye the words of this
Couenant, and doe them.</ab>
<ab n="7">For I earnestly
protested vnto your fathers, in the day that I brought them vp out
of the land of Egypt, euen vnto this day, rising earely and
protesting, saying, Obey my voice.</ab>
<ab n="8">Yet they obeyed
not, nor inclined their eare: but walked euery one in the
imagination of their euill heart: therefore I will bring vpon them
all the words of this Couenant, which I commaunded them to doe; but
they did them not.<note> Or, stubburnnesse.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And the Lord
said vnto me, A conspiracie is found among the men of Iudah, and
among the inhabitants of Ierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="10">They are turned
backe to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to
heare my wordes: and they went after other gods to serue them: the
house of Israel, and the house of Iudah haue broken my Couenant,
which I made with their fathers.</ab>
<ab n="11">¶
Therefore thus sayeth the Lord, Behold, I will bring euill vpon
them which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall
crie vnto mee, I will not hearken vnto them.<note> Hebr. to goe forth of. , Prou.1.28. isa.1.15. cha. 14. 12. eze. 8. 18. mich. 3. 8.</note></ab>

<fw>Iudahs idolatrie.</fw>
<ab n="12">Then shall the
cities of Iudah, and inhabitants of Ierusalem goe, and crie vnto
the gods vnto whom they offer incense; but they shall not saue them
at all in the time of their trouble.<note> Heb. euill.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">For according
to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Iudah, and according
to the number of the streetes of Ierusalem haue ye set vp altars to
that shamefull thing, euen altars to burne incense vnto
Baal.<note> Cha.2.28. , Heb. shame</note></ab>
<ab n="14">Therefore pray
not thou for this people, neither lift vp a cry or prayer for them:
for I will not heare them in the time that they crie vnto mee for
their trouble.<note> Cha.7.16. and 14.11. , Heb. euill.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">What hath my
beloued to doe in mine house, seeing shee hath wrought lewdnesse
with many? and the holy flesh is passed from thee: when thou doest
euill, then thou reioycest.<note> Isai. 1.11. &amp;c. , Heb. what is to my beloued in my house? , Or, when thy euill is.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">The Lord called
thy name, A greene oliue tree, faire and of goodly fruite: with the
noise of a great tumult hee hath kindled fire vpon it, and the
branches of it are broken.</ab>
<ab n="17">For the Lord of
hostes that planted thee, hath pronounced euill against thee, for
the euill of the house of Israel, and of the house of Iudah, which
they haue done against themselues to prouoke mee to anger in
offering incense vnto Baal.</ab>
<ab n="18">¶ And the
Lord hath giuen mee knowledge of it, and I knowe it, then thou
shewedst me their doings.</ab>
<ab n="19">But I was like
a lambe or an oxe that is brought to the slaughter, and I knew not
that they had deuised deuices against me, saying; Let vs destroy
the tree with the fruit thereof, and let vs cut him off from the
land of the liuing, that his name may be no more
remembred.<note> Heb. the stalke with his bread.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">But, O Lord of
hostes, that iudgest righteously, that tryest the reines, and the
heart; let me see thy vengeance on them, for vnto thee haue I
reuealed my cause.<note> 1.Sam.16.7. 1.chron.28.9. psal.7.10. and 20.12. cha.17.10. and 20.12. reue.2.23.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">Therefore thus
saith the Lord of the men of Anathoth, that seeke thy life, saying;
Prophecie not in the Name of the Lord, that thou die not by our
hand:</ab>
<ab n="22">Therefore thus
saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, I wil punish them: the young men
shall die by the sword, their sonnes and their daughters shall die
by famine.<note> Heb. visite vpon.</note></ab>

<fw>The wicked prosper.</fw>
<ab n="23">And there shall
be no remnant of them, for I will bring euill vpon the men of
Anathoth, euen the yere of their visitation.</ab>
