<head>CHAP. XI.</head>
<head>1 An exhortation to obedience, 2 by
their owne experience of Gods great works, 8 by promise of Gods

required in Gods words. 26 The blessing and curse is set before
them.</head>

<ab n="1">Therefore
thou shalt loue the Lord thy God, and keepe his charge, and his
Statutes, and his Iudgements, and his Commandements alway.</ab>
<ab n="2">And know you
this day: for I speake not with your children which haue not
knowen, and which haue not seene the chastisement of the Lord your
God, his greatnesse, his mighty hand, and his stretched out
arme,</ab>
<ab n="3">And his
miracles, and his actes, which he did in the midst of Egypt, vnto
Pharaoh the King of Egypt, and vnto all his land,</ab>
<ab n="4">And what hee
did vnto the army of Egypt, vnto their horses, and to their
charets, how he made the water of the Red sea to ouerflow them as
they pursued after you, and how the Lord hath destroyed them vnto
this day,</ab>
<ab n="5">And what hee
did vnto you in the wildernesse, vntill yee came into this
place,</ab>

<fw>Promises to the obedient.</fw>
<ab n="6">And what he
did vnto Dathan, and Abiram, the sonnes of Eliab the sonne of
Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them vp, and
their housholds, and their tents, and all the substance that was in
their possession in the middest of all Israel.<note> Num, 16. 31, and 27. 3. psal. 106. 17. , Or, liuing substance which followed them. , Heb. was at their feet.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">But your eyes
haue seene all the great acts of the Lord, which he did.</ab>
<ab n="8">Therefore
shall yee keepe all the Commandements which I command you this day,
that ye may be strong and goe in, and possesse the land whither ye
goe to possesse it:</ab>
<ab n="9">And that yee
may prolong your dayes in the lande which the Lord sware vnto your
fathers to giue vnto them, and to their seed, a land that floweth
with milke and hony.</ab>
<ab n="10">¶ For
the land whither thou goest in to possesse it, is not as the lande
of Egypt from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and
wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbes:</ab>
<ab n="11">But the
lande whither ye goe to possesse it, is a lande of hilles and
valleys, and drinketh water of the raine of heauen:</ab>
<ab n="12">A lande,
which the Lord thy God careth for: the eyes of the Lord thy God are
alwayes vpon it, from the beginning of the yeere, euen vnto the end
of the yeere.<note> Heb. seeketh,</note></ab>
<ab n="13">¶ And
it shall come to passe, if you shall hearken diligently vnto my
Commandements which I command you this day, to loue the Lord your
God, and to serue him with all your heart, and with all your
soule;</ab>
<ab n="14">That I will
giue you the raine of your land in his due season, the first raine
and the latter raine, that thou mayest gather in thy corne, and thy
wine, and thine oyle.</ab>
<ab n="15">And I will
send grasse in thy fields for thy cattell, that thou mayest eate
and be full.<note> Heb. giue.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">Take heede
to your selues, that your heart be not deceiued, and ye turne
aside, and serue other gods, and worship them:</ab>
<ab n="17">And then the
Lords wrath be kindled against you, and hee shut vp the heauen,
that there be no raine, and that the land yeeld not her fruit, and
lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giueth
you.</ab>

<fw>Promises to the obedient.</fw>
<ab n="18">¶
Therefore shall ye lay vp these my words in your heart, and in your
soule, and bind them for a signe vpon your hand, that they may bee
as frontlets betweene your eyes.<note> Chap. 6. 8.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">And ye shal
teach them your children, speaking of them, when thou sittest in
thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest
downe, and when thou risest vp.<note> Chap. 4. 10. &amp; 6. 7.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">And thou
shalt write them vpon the doore posts of thine house, and vpon thy
gates:</ab>
<ab n="21">That your
dayes may bee multiplied, and the dayes of your children, in the
land which the Lord sware vnto your fathers to giue them, as the
dayes of heauen vpon the earth.</ab>
<ab n="22">¶ For
if ye shall diligently keepe all these Commaundements which I
command you, to doe them, to loue the Lord your God, to walke in
all his wayes, and to cleaue vnto him:</ab>
<ab n="23">Then will
the Lord driue out all these nations from before you, and ye shall
possesse greater nations, and mightier then your selues.</ab>
<ab n="24">Euery place
whereon the soles of your feet shall tread, shall be yours: from
the wildernesse, and Lebanon, from the riuer, the riuer Euphrates,
euen vnto the vttermost sea, shall your coast be.<note> Iosh. 1. 3.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">There shall
no man bee able to stand before you: for the Lord your God shall
lay the feare of you, and the dread of you vpon all the land that
yee shall tread vpon, as hee hath said vnto you.</ab>
<ab n="26">¶
Behold, I set before you this day, a blessing and a curse:</ab>
<ab n="27">A blessing,
if ye obey the Commandements of the Lord your God which I command
you this day:<note> Chap. 28. 2.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">And a curse,
if ye will not obey the Commandements of the Lord your God, but
turne aside out of the way, which I command you this day, to goe
after other gods which yee haue not knowen.<note> Chap. 28. 15.</note></ab>
<ab n="29">And it shall
come to passe when the Lord thy God hath brought thee in, vnto the
land whither thou goest to possesse it, that thou shalt put the
blessing vpon mount Gerizim, and the curse vpon mount
Ebal.<note> Chap. 27. 13. iosh.8. 33.</note></ab>

<fw>The place of burnt offrings.</fw>
<ab n="30">Are they not
on the other side Iordan, by the way where the Sunne goeth downe,
in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champion ouer
against Gilgal, beside the plaines of Moreh?</ab>
<ab n="31">For ye shall
passe ouer Iordan, to goe in to possesse the land which the Lord
your God giueth you, and ye shall possesse it, and dwell
therein.</ab>
<ab n="32">And yee
shall obserue to doe all the Statutes, and Iudgements, which I set
before you this day.<note> Chap. 5. 32.</note></ab>
