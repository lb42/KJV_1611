<fw>Famine in Israel.</fw>
<ab n="1">Then there was a
famine in the dayes of Dauid three yeeres, yeere after yeere, and
Dauid enquired of the Lord. And the Lord answered, It is for Saul,
and for his bloodie house, because he slew the
Gibeonites.<note> Heb. sought the face &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And the king
called the Gibeonites, and said vnto them, (now the Gibeonites were
not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites,
and the children of Israel had sworne vnto them: and Saul sought to
slay them, in his zeale to the children of Israel and
Iudah)<note> Iosh. 9.3. 16,17.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">Wherefore Dauid
said vnto the Gibeonites, What shall I doe for you? and wherwith
shall I make the atonement, that ye may blesse the inheritance of
the Lord ?</ab>
<ab n="4">And the
Gibeonites saide vnto him, We will haue no siluer nor golde of
Saul, nor of his house, neither for vs shalt thou kill any man in
Israel. And he said, What you shall say, that will I doe for
you.<note> Or, It is not siluer or gold that we haue to doe with Saul or his house, neither pertaines it to vs to kil &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">And they
answered the king, The man that consumed vs, and that deuised
against vs, that we should be destroied from remaining in any of
the coasts of Israel,<note> Or, cut vs off.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">Let seuen men of
his sonnes bee deliuered vnto vs, and wee will hang them vp vnto
the Lord in Gibeah of Saul, whome the Lord did chuse. And the king
said, I will giue them.<note> Or, chosen of the Lord.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">But the king
spared Mephibosheth the sonne of Ionathan the sonne of Saul,
because of the Lords othe that was between them, betweene Dauid,
and Ionathan the sonne of Saul.<note> 1.Sam.18 3. and 20.8, 42.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">But the king
tooke the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare
vnto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth, and the fiue sonnes of Michal
the daughter of Saul, whome she brought vp for Adriel the sonne of
Barzillai the Meholathite.<note> Or, Michals sister. , Heb. bare to Adriel.</note></ab>

<fw>Sauls bones buried.</fw>
<ab n="9">And hee
deliuered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged
them in the hill before the Lord: and they fell all seuen together,
and were put to death in the dayes of haruest, in the first dayes,
in the beginning of barley haruest.</ab>
<ab n="10">¶ And
Rizpah the daughter of Aiah tooke sackecloth, and spread it for her
vpon the rocke, from the beginning of haruest, vntill water dropped
vpon them out of heauen, and suffered neither the birds of the aire
to rest on them by day, nor the beastes of the fielde by
night.<note> Chap. 3.7.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And it was
tolde Dauid what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah the concubine of Saul
had done.</ab>
<ab n="12">¶ And
Dauid went and tooke the bones of Saul, and the bones of Ionathan
his sonne from the men of Iabesh Gilead, which had stollen them
from the street of Bethshan where the Philistines had hanged them,
when the Philistines had slaine Saul in Gilboa.<note> 1. Sam. 31.10.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">And hee brought
vp from thence the bones of Saul, and the bones of Ionathan his
sonne, and they gathered the bones of them that were
hanged.</ab>
<ab n="14">And the bones
of Saul and Ionathan his sonne buried they in the countrey of
Beniamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they
perfourmed all that the king commanded: and after that, God was
entreated for the land.</ab>
<ab n="15">¶
Moreouer, the Philistines had yet warre againe with Israel, and
Dauid went down, and his seruants with him, and fought against the
Philistines, and Dauid waxed faint.</ab>
<ab n="16">And Ishbi-benob
which was of the sonnes of the gyant, (the weight of whose speare
weighed three hundred shekels of brasse in weight) he being girded
with a new sword, thought to haue slaine Dauid.<note> Or, Rapha. , Heb. the staffe, or the head.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">But Abishai the
sonne of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and
killed him. Then the men of Dauid sware vnto him, saying, Thou
shalt goe no more out with vs to battell, that thou quench not the
light of Israel.<note> Heb. candle, or lampe</note></ab>
<ab n="18">And it came to
passe after this, that there was againe a battell with the
Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which
was of the sonnes of the Gyant.<note> 1.Chron. 20.4. , Or, Rapha.</note></ab>

<fw>Dauids song.</fw>
<ab n="19">And there was
againe a battell in Gob, with the Philistines, where Elhanan the
sonne of Iaare-Oregim a Bethlehemite, slewe the brother of Goliath
the Gittite, the staffe of whose speare was like a weauers
beame.<note> See 1. Chro.20.5.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">And there was
yet a battell in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had
on euery hand sixe fingers, and on euery foote sixe toes, foure and
twenty in number, and he also was borne to the Gyant.<note> Or, Rapha.</note></ab>

defied Israel, Ionathan the sonne of Shimea the brother of Dauid,
slew him.<note> Or, reproched. , 1. Sam. 16.9.</note></ab>

were borne to the Gyant in Gath, and fell by the hand of Dauid, and
by the hand of his seruants.</ab>
