<head>CHAP.
III.</head>
<head>1 Christ is more worthy then Moses,
7 therefore if we beleeue not in him, we shalbe more worthy
punishmēt then hard hearted Israel.</head>

<ab n="1">Wherfore holy
brethrē, partakers of the heauenly calling, consider the
Apostle and high Priest of our profession Christ Iesus,</ab>
<ab n="2">Who was faithful
to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithfull in all his
house.<note> Gr. made, 1.Sam.12.6</note></ab>
<ab n="3">For this man was
counted worthy of more glory then Moses, in as much as he who hath
builded the house, hath more honour then the house.</ab>
<ab n="4">For euery house is
builded by some man, but hee that built all things is God.</ab>
<ab n="5">And Moses verely
was faithfull in all his house as a seruant, for a testimonie of
those things which were to be spoken after.</ab>
<ab n="6">But Christ as a
Sonne ouer his owne house, whose house are wee, if we hold fast the
confidence, and the reioycing of the hope firme vnto the
end.</ab>
<ab n="7">Wherfore as the
holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will heare his voyce,<note> Psal.95.7.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Harden not your
hearts, as in the prouocation, in the day of temptation in the
wildernesse:</ab>
<ab n="9">When your fathers
tempted me, prooued me, and saw my works fourty yeeres.</ab>
<ab n="10">Wherefore I was
grieued with that generation, and sayd, They doe alway erre in
their hearts, and they haue not knowen my wayes.</ab>
<ab n="11">So I sware in my
wrath: they shall not enter into my rest.<note> Gr. if they shall enter.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">Take heed,
brethren, lest there be in any of you an euill heart of vnbeleefe,
in departing from the liuing God.</ab>

<fw>Vnbeleeuers.</fw>
<ab n="13">But exhort one
another dayly, while it is called To day, least any of you be
hardned through the deceitfulnesse of sinne.</ab>
<ab n="14">For wee are made
partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence
stedfast vnto the end.</ab>
<ab n="15">Whilest it is
sayd, To day if yee will heare his voice, harden not your hearts,
as in the prouocation.</ab>
<ab n="16">For some when
they had heard, did prouoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt
by Moses.</ab>
<ab n="17">But with whom was
he grieued fourty yeeres? was it not with them that had sinned,
whose carcases fell in the wildernesse?</ab>
<ab n="18">And to whom sware
he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that
beleeued not?</ab>
<ab n="19">So we see that
they could not enter in, because of vnbeleefe.</ab>
