<head>CHAP. IV.</head>
<head>1 God calleth Israel by his promise.
3 He exhorteth Iudah to repentance by fearefull iudgements. 19 A
grieuous lamentation for the miseries of Iudah.</head>

<ab n="1">If thou wilt
returne, O Israel, saith the Lord, returne vnto mee: and if thou
wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou
not remoue.<note> Ioel 2. 12.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And thou shalt
sweare, The Lord liueth, in Trueth, in Iudgement, and in
Righteousnes, and the nations shall blesse themselues in him, and
in him shall they glorie.<note> 2.Cor.10. 17.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">¶ For thus
saith the Lord to the men of Iudah and Ierusalem, Breake vp your
fallow ground, and sow not among thornes.</ab>
<ab n="4">Circumcise your
selues to the Lord, and take away the foreskinnes of your heart, ye
men of Iudah, and inhabitants of Ierusalem, lest my furie come
forth like fire, and burne that none can quench it, because of the
euill of your doings.</ab>
<ab n="5">Declare ye in
Iudah, and publish in Ierusalem, and say, Blow yee the Trumpet in
the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble your selues, and
let vs goe into the defenced cities.</ab>

<fw>Against Iudah.</fw>
<ab n="6">Set vp the
standards toward Zion: retyre, stay not; for I will bring euil from
the North, and a great destruction.<note> Or, strengthen. , Chap. 1. 13, 14, 23. chap. 6. 26. , Hebr. breaking.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">The Lion is come
vp from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his
way; hee is gone foorth from his place to make thy land desolate,
and thy cities shall be layed waste, without an inhabitant.</ab>
<ab n="8">For this gird you
with sackcloth; lament and howle: for the fierce anger of the Lord
is not turned backe from vs.<note> Chap. 6. 26.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And it shall come
to passe at that day, saith the Lord, that the heart of the King
shall perish, and the heart of the Princes: and the Priests shalbe
astonished, &amp; the prophets shall wonder.</ab>
<ab n="10">Then said I, Ah
Lord God, surely thou hast greatly deceiued this people, and
Ierusalem, saying, Ye shall haue peace, whereas the sword reacheth
vnto the soule.</ab>
<ab n="11">At that time
shall it bee said to this people, and to Ierusalem; A dry winde of
the high places in the wildernes toward the daughter of my people,
not to fanne, nor to cleanse.</ab>
<ab n="12">Euen a full
winde from those places shall come vnto mee: now also will I giue
sentence against them.<note> Or, a fuller winde then those. , Hebr. vtter iudgements.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Behold, hee
shall come vp as cloudes, and his charets shall bee as a
whirlewinde: his horses are swifter then Eagles: woe vnto vs, for
wee are spoiled.</ab>
<ab n="14">O Ierusalem,
wash thine heart from wickednesse, that thou mayest bee saued: how
long shall thy vaine thoughts lodge within thee?<note> Isa. 1.16.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">For a voice
declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount
Ephraim.<note> Chap.8. 16.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">Make ye mention
to the nations, behold, publish against Ierusalem, that watchers
come from a farre countrey, and giue out their voice against the
cities of Iudah.</ab>
<ab n="17">As keepers of a
fielde are they against her round about; because shee hath bene
rebellious against mee, saith the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="18">Thy way and thy
doings haue procured these things vnto thee, this is thy wickednes
because it is bitter, because it reacheth vnto thine
heart.<note> Psal.107. 17. isa. 50. 1.</note></ab>

<fw>Wise to doe euill.</fw>
<ab n="19">¶ My
bowels, my bowels, I am pained at my very heart, my heart maketh a
noise in mee, I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my
soule, the sound of the Trumpet, the alarme of warre.<note> Isa.22.4. chap.9.1. , Hebr. the walles of my heart.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">Destruction vpon
destruction is cried, for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are
my tents spoiled, and my curtaines in a moment.</ab>
<ab n="21">How long shal I
see the standard and heare the sound of the Trumpet?</ab>
<ab n="22">For my people is
foolish, they haue not knowen me, they are sottish children, and
they haue none vnderstanding: they are wise to doe euill, but to
doe good they haue no knowledge.</ab>
<ab n="23">I beheld the
earth, and loe, it was without forme and void: and the heauens, and
they had no light.</ab>
<ab n="24">I beheld the
mountaines, and loe they trembled, and all the hilles mooued
lightly.</ab>
<ab n="25">I behelde, and
loe, there was no man, and all the birdes of the heauens were
fled.</ab>
<ab n="26">I beheld, and
loe, the fruitfull place was a wildernesse, and all the cities
thereof were broken downe at the presence of the Lord, and by his
fierce anger.</ab>
<ab n="27">For thus hath
the Lord said; The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not
make a full ende.<note> Cha.5.18.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">For this shall
the earth mourne, and the heauens aboue be blacke: because I haue
spoken it, I haue purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I
turne backe from it.</ab>
<ab n="29">The whole citie
shall flee, for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen, they shall
goe into thickets, and climbe vp vpon the rockes: euery city shall
be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.</ab>
<ab n="30">And when thou
art spoiled, what wilt thou doe? though thou clothest thy selfe
with crimsin, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of golde,
though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vaine shalt thou
make thy selfe faire, thy louers will despise thee, they will seeke
thy life.<note> Heb. eyes.</note></ab>
<ab n="31">For I haue heard
a voice as of a woman in trauel, and the anguish as of her that
bringeth foorth her first childe, the voice of the daughter of
Zion, that bewaileth her selfe, that spreadeth her hands, saying;
Woe is me now, for my soule is wearied because of
murderers.</ab>
