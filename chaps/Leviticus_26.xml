in your enemies land, euen then shall the land rest, and enioy her
Sabbaths.</ab>

lieth desolate, it shall rest: because it did not rest in your
Sabbaths, when ye dwelt vpon it.</ab>
<ab n="36">And vpon them

you vp.</ab>
<ab n="39">And they that
are left of you shall pine away in their iniquitie in your enemies
lands, and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine
away with them.</ab>
<ab n="40">If they shall
confesse the iniquitie of their fathers, with their trespasse which
they trespassed against me, and that also they haue walked contrary
vnto me:</ab>
<ab n="41">And that I
also haue walked contrary vnto them, and haue brought them into the
land of their enemies: if then their vncircumcised hearts bee
humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their
iniquitie:</ab>
<ab n="42">Then will I
remember my couenant with Iacob, and also my couenant with Isaac,
and also my couenant with Abraham will I remember, and I will
remember the land.</ab>

<fw>Of vowes, and their redemption.</fw>
<ab n="43">The land also
shalbe left of them, and shall enioy her Sabbaths, while she lieth
desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of
their iniquitie: because, euen because they despised my Iudgements,
and because their soule abhorred my Statutes</ab>
<ab n="44">And yet for
all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not
cast them away, neither will I abhorre them, to destroy them
vtterly, and to breake my couenant with them: for I am the Lord
their God.<note> Deut.4. 31. rom. 11.26.</note></ab>
<ab n="45">But I wil for
their sakes remember the couenant of their Ancestours, whom I
brought forth out of the land of Egypt, in the sight of the
Heathen, that I might be their God: I am the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="46">These are the
Statutes, and Iudgements, and Lawes which the Lord made betweene
him and the children of Israel, in mount Sinai, by the hand of
Moses.</ab>
