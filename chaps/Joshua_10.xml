<head>CHAP. X.</head>
<head>1 Fiue Kings warre against Gibeon. 6
Ioshua rescueth it. 10 God fighteth against them with hailestones.
12 The Sunne and Moone stand still at the word of Ioshua. 16 The
fiue Kings are mured in a caue. 21 They are brought forth, 24
scornefully vsed, 26 and hanged. 28 Seuen Kings more are conquered.
43 Ioshua returneth to Gilgal.</head>

<ab n="1">Now it came to
passe when Adoni-zedek King of Ierusalem, had heard how Ioshua had
taken Ai, and had vtterly destroyed it, ( as he had done to
Iericho, and her King, so hee had done to Ai, and her King) and how
the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were
among them,<note> Chap.6. 15. , Chap. 8.3.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">That they feared
greatly because Gibeon was a great citie, as one of the royall
cities, and because it was greater then Ai, and all the men thereof
were mighty.<note> Hebr. cities of the kingdome.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">Wherefore
Adoni-zedek King of Ierusalem, sent vnto Hoham King of Hebron, and
vnto Piram, king of Iarmuth, and vnto Iaphia king of Lachish, and
vnto Debir king of Eglon, saying,</ab>
<ab n="4">Come vp vnto me,
and helpe me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with
Ioshua, and with the children of Israel.</ab>
<ab n="5">Therefore the fiue
Kings of the Amorites, the king of Ierusalem, the king of Hebron,
the king of Iarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon,
gathered themselues together, and went vp, they, and all their
hostes, and encamped before Gibeon, and made warre against
it.</ab>
<ab n="6">¶ And the men
of Gibeon sent vnto Ioshua to the campe to Gilgal, saying, Slacke
not thy hand from thy seruants, come vp to vs quickly, and saue vs,
and helpe vs: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the
mountaines, are gathered together against vs.</ab>
<ab n="7">So Ioshua ascended
from Gilgal, he, and all the people of warre with him, and all the
mighty men of valour.</ab>
<ab n="8">¶ And the
Lord said vnto Ioshua, Feare them not: for I haue deliuered them
into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before
thee.</ab>

<fw>The Sun standeth.</fw>
<ab n="9">Ioshua therefore
came vnto them suddenly, and went vp from Gilgal all night.</ab>
<ab n="10">And the Lord
discomfited them before Israel, and slewe them with a great
slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth vp to
Bethoron, and smote them to Azekah and vnto Makkedah.</ab>
<ab n="11">And it came to
passe as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going downe
to Bethoron, that the Lord cast downe great stones from heauen vpon
them, vnto Azekah, and they died: they were moe which died with
hailestones, then they whome the children of Israel slew with the
sword.</ab>
<ab n="12">¶ Then spake
Ioshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord deliuered vp the
Amorites before the children of Israel, and hee said in the sight
of Israel, Sunne, stand thou still vpon Gibeon, and thou Moone in
the valley of Aialon.<note> Esa.28.21 ecclus.46.4 , Heb. bee silent.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">And the Sunne
stood still, and the Moone stayed, vntill the people had auenged
themselues vpō their enemies. Is not this written in the booke
of Iasher? So the Sunne stood still in the midst of heauen, and
hasted not to goe downe, about a whole day.<note> Or, the vpright?</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And there was no
day like that, before it, or after it, that the Lord hearkened vnto
the voyce of a man: for the Lord fought for Israel.</ab>
<ab n="15">¶ And Ioshua
returned, and all Israel with him, vnto the campe to
Gilgal.</ab>
<ab n="16">But these fiue
kings fled, and hid themselues in a caue at Makkedah.</ab>
<ab n="17">And it was told
Ioshua, saying, The fiue kings are found hid in a caue at
Makkedah.</ab>
<ab n="18">And Ioshua said,
Roule great stones vpon the mouth of the caue, and set men by it,
for to keepe them.</ab>
<ab n="19">And stay you not,
but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them,
suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the Lord your God
hath deliuered them into your hand.<note> Heb. cut off the taile.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">And it came to
passe when Ioshua and the children of Israel had made an end of
slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed,
that the rest which remained of them, entred into fenced
cities.</ab>

<fw>Fiue kings hanged.</fw>
<ab n="21">And all the
people returned to the campe to Ioshua at Makkedah in peace: none
mooued his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</ab>
<ab n="22">Then said Ioshua,
Open the mouth of the caue, and bring out those fiue kings vnto me
out of the caue.</ab>
<ab n="23">And they did so,
and brought forth those fiue kings vnto him out of the caue, the
king of Ierusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Iarmuth, the
king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.</ab>
<ab n="24">And it came to
passe when they brought out those kings vnto Ioshua, that Ioshua
called for all the men of Israel, and saide vnto the captaines of
the men of war which went with him, Come neere, put your feete vpon
the neckes of these kings. And they came neere, and put their feet
vpon the necks of them.</ab>
<ab n="25">And Ioshua said
vnto them, Feare not, nor be dismaid, bee strong, and of good
courage: for thus shall the Lord doe to all your enemies against
whom ye fight.</ab>
<ab n="26">And afterward
Ioshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on fiue trees:
and they were hanging vpon the trees vntill the euening.</ab>
<ab n="27">And it came to
passe at the time of the going downe of the Sunne, that Ioshua
commanded, and they tooke them downe off the trees, and cast them
into the caue, wherein they had beene hid, and laid great stones in
the caues mouth, which remain vntil this very day.<note> Deut. 21. 23. chap. 8. 29.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">¶ And that
day Ioshua tooke Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword,
and the king thereof hee vtterly destroyed, them, and all the
soules that were therein, he let none remaine: and he did to the
king of Makkedah, as hee did vnto the king of Iericho.<note> Chap. 6. 21.</note></ab>
<ab n="29">Then Ioshua
passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, vnto Libnah, and
fought against Libnah.</ab>
<ab n="30">And the Lord
deliuered it also and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel,
and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the soules that
were therein: He let none remaine in it, but did vnto the king
therof, as he did vnto the king of Iericho.</ab>
<ab n="31">¶ And Ioshua
passed from Libnah and all Israel with him, vnto Lachish, and
encamped against it, and fought against it.</ab>

<fw>Ioshua conquereth diuers kings.</fw>
<ab n="32">And the Lord
deliuered Lachish into the hande of Israel, which tooke it on the
second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the
soules that were therein, according to all that he had done to
Libnah.</ab>
<ab n="33">¶ Then Horam
king of Gezer, came vp to helpe Lachish, and Ioshua smote him and
his people, vntill he had left him none remayning.</ab>
<ab n="34">¶ And from
Lachish, Ioshua passed vnto Eglon, and all Israel with him, and
they encamped against it, and fought against it.</ab>
<ab n="35">And they tooke it
on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the
soules that were therein he vtterly destroyed that day, according
to all that he had done to Lachish.</ab>
<ab n="36">And Ioshua went
vp from Eglon, and all Israel with him, vnto Hebron, and they
fought against it.</ab>
<ab n="37">And they tooke
it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof,
and all the cities thereof, and all the soules that were therein,
he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon:
but destroyed it vtterly, and all the soules that were
therein.</ab>
<ab n="38">¶ And Ioshua
returned, and all Israel with him to Debir, and fought against
it.</ab>
<ab n="39">And hee tooke it,
and the King thereof, and all the cities thereof, and they smote
them with the edge of the sword, and vtterly destroyed all the
soules that were therein, he left none remayning: as he had done to
Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof, as he had done
also to Libnah, and to her king.</ab>
<ab n="40">¶ So Ioshua
smote all the countrey of the hils, and of the South, and of the
vale, and of the springs, and all their kings, hee left none
remayning, but vtterly destroyed all that breathed, as the Lord God
of Israel commanded.<note> Deut. 26. 16,17.</note></ab>
<ab n="41">And Ioshua smote
them from Kadesh-Barnea, euen vnto Gaza, and all the countrey of
Goshen, euen vnto Gibeon.</ab>
<ab n="42">And all these
Kings and their land did Ioshua take at one time: because the Lord
God of Israel fought for Israel.</ab>
<ab n="43">And Ioshua
returned &amp; al Israel with him, vnto the campe to
Gilgal.</ab>
