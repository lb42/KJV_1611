<head>CHAP. I.</head>
<head>1 Moses speech in the end of the
fortieth yeere, briefly rehearsing the story, 6 of Gods promise, 9
of giuing them officers, 19 of sending the spies to search the
land, 34 of Gods anger for their incredulitie, 41 and
disobedience.</head>

<ab n="1">These bee the
woordes which Moses spake vnto all Israel, on this side Iordane in
the wildernes, in the plaine ouer against the Red sea, betweene
Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and
Dizahab.<note> Or, Zuph.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">(There are
eleuen daies iourney from Horeb, by the way of mount Seir, vnto
Kadesh Barnea.)</ab>
<ab n="3">And it came to
passe in the fourtieth yeere, in the eleuenth moneth, on the first
day of the moneth, that Moses spake vnto the children of Israel,
according vnto all that the Lord had giuen him in commandement vnto
them:</ab>
<ab n="4">After hee had
slaine Sihon the King of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and
Og the King of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth, in
Edrei.<note> Num.21. 24.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">On this side
Iordane, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law,
saying,</ab>
<ab n="6">The Lord our
God spake vnto vs in Horeb, saying, Ye haue dwelt long ynough in
this mount:</ab>
<ab n="7">Turne you, and
take your iourney, and goe to the mount of the Amorites, and vnto
all the places nigh thereunto, in the plaine, in the hills, and in
the vale, and in the South, and by the sea side, to the land of the
Canaanites, and vnto Lebanon, vnto the great riuer, the riuer
Euphrates.<note> Hebr. all his neighbours.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Behold, I haue
set the land before you: Goe in, and possesse the land, which the
Lord sware vnto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, to giue
vnto them, and to their seed after them.<note> Hebr. giuen. , Gene. 15. 18.and 17. 7, 8.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">¶ And I
spake vnto you at that time, saying, I am not able to beare you my
selfe alone:</ab>

<fw>A repetition of former things.</fw>
<ab n="10">The Lord your
God hath multiplied you, and beholde, you are this day as the
starres of heauen for multitude.</ab>
<ab n="11">(The Lord God
of your fathers make you a thousand times so many moe as ye are,
and blesse you as he hath promised you.)</ab>
<ab n="12">How can I my
selfe alone beare your cumbrance, and your burden, and your
strife?</ab>
<ab n="13">Take ye wise
men, and vnderstanding, and knowen among your tribes, and I will
make them rulers ouer you.<note> Heb. giue.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And ye
answered me, and saide, The thing which thou hast spoken, is good
for vs to doe.</ab>
<ab n="15">So I tooke
the chiefe of your tribes, wise men, and knowen, and made them
heads ouer you, captaines ouer thousands, and captaines ouer
hundreds, and captaines ouer fifties, and captaines ouer tennes,
and officers among your tribes.<note> Heb. gaue.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">And I charged
your Iudges at that time, saying, Heare the causes betweene your
brethren, and iudge righteously betweene euery man and his brother,
&amp; the stranger that is with him.<note> Ioh.7.24.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">Ye shall not
respect persons in iudgement, but you shall heare the small aswell
as the great: you shall not bee afraid of the face of man, for the
iudgment is Gods: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it
vnto me, and I will heare it.<note> Leuit.19. 15.chap.16 19. 1.sam. 16.7. pro. 24.23. , Hebr. acknowledge faces.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">And I
commanded you at that time all the things which ye should
doe.</ab>
<ab n="19">¶ And
when wee departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and
terrible wildernes, which you saw by the way of the mountaine of
the Amorites, as the Lord our God commanded vs: and wee came to
Kadesh Barnea.</ab>
<ab n="20">And I said
vnto you, Ye are come vnto the mountaine of the Amorites, which the
Lord our God doth giue vnto vs.</ab>
<ab n="21">Behold, the
Lord thy God hath set the land before thee: Goe vp, and possesse
it, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath said vnto thee: Feare not,
neither be discouraged.</ab>

<fw>A repetition of former things.</fw>
<ab n="22">¶ And ye
came neere vnto mee euery one of you, and said, We will send men
before vs, and they shall search vs out the land, and bring vs word
againe, by what way we must goe vp, and into what cities we shall
come.</ab>
<ab n="23">And the
saying pleased mee well: and I tooke twelue men of you, one of a
tribe.<note> Num.13. 3.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">And they
turned and went vp into the mountaine, and came vnto the valley of
Eshcol, and searched it out.<note> Num.13. 24.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">And they
tooke of the fruit of the land in their handes, and brought it
downe vnto vs, and brought vs worde againe, and said, It is a good
lande which the Lord our God doeth giue vs.</ab>
<ab n="26">Notwithstanding,
ye would not goe vp, but rebelled against the commandement of the
Lord your God.</ab>
<ab n="27">And ye
murmured in your tents and said, Because the Lord hated vs, he hath
brought vs forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliuer vs into the
hand of the Amorites, to destroy vs:</ab>
<ab n="28">Whither shall
wee goe vp? our brethren haue discouraged our heart, saying, The
people is greater and taller then we, the cities are great, and
walled vp to heauen, and moreouer we haue seene the sonnes of the
Anakims there.<note> Heb. melted. , Num. 13. 29.</note></ab>
<ab n="29">Then I said
vnto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</ab>
<ab n="30">The Lord your
God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to
all that hee did for you in Egypt before your eyes:</ab>
<ab n="31">And in the
wildernes, where thou hast seene how that the Lord thy God bare
thee, as a man doth beare his sonne, in all the way that ye went,
vntil ye came into this place.</ab>
<ab n="32">Yet in this
thing ye did not beleeue the Lord your God,</ab>
<ab n="33">Who went in
the way before you to search you out a place to pitch your tents
in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should goe, and in
a cloud by day.<note> Exod.13. 21.</note></ab>
<ab n="34">And the Lord
heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware,
saying,</ab>
<ab n="35">Surely there
shall not one of these men of this euill generation see that good
land, which I sware to giue vnto your fathers:<note> Num.14. 29.</note></ab>
<ab n="36">Saue Caleb
the sonne of Iephunneh, he shall see it, and to him will I giue the
land that he hath troden vpon, and to his children, because hee
hath wholly followed the Lord.<note> Heb. fulfilled to goe after.</note></ab>

<fw>A repetition of former things.</fw>
<ab n="37">Also the Lord
was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not goe
in thither.<note> Num. 20. 12. and 27. 14. , Chap. 3. 26. and 4. 21. and 34. 4.</note></ab>
<ab n="38">But Ioshua
the sonne of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall goe in
thither. Encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherite
it.</ab>
<ab n="39">Moreouer,
your litle ones, which ye said should be a pray, and your children,
which in that day had no knowledge betweene good and euil, they
shall goe in thither; and vnto them will I giue it, and they shall
possesse it.</ab>
<ab n="40">But as for
you, turne ye, and take your iourney into the wildernesse, by the
way of the Red sea.</ab>
<ab n="41">Then ye
answered, and said vnto mee, Wee haue sinned against the Lord, we
will goe vp and fight, according to all that the Lord our God
commanded vs. And when ye had girded on euery man his weapons of
warre, yee were ready to goe vp into the hill.<note> Num. 14. 40.</note></ab>
<ab n="42">And the Lord
said vnto me, Say vnto them, Goe not vp, neither fight, for I am
not among you: least ye be smitten before your enemies.</ab>
<ab n="43">So I spake
vnto you, and you would not heare, but rebelled against the
commandement of the Lord, and went presumptuously vp into the
hill.<note> Heb. you were presumptuous and went vp.</note></ab>
<ab n="44">And the
Amorites which dwelt in that mountaine, came out against you, and
chased you, as Bees doe, and destroyed you in Seir, euen vnto
Hormah.</ab>
<ab n="45">And ye
returned and wept before the Lord; but the Lord would not hearken
to your voyce, nor giue eare vnto you.</ab>
<ab n="46">So yee abode
in Kadesh many dayes, according vnto the dayes that ye abode
there.</ab>
