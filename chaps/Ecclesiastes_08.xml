<head>CHAP.
VIII.</head>
<head>1 Kings are greatly to bee
respected. 6 The Diuine prouidence is to be obserued. 12 It is
better with the godly in aduersitie, then with the wicked in
prosperity. 16 The worke of God is vnsearchable.</head>

<ab n="1">Who is as the
Wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a mans
wisedome maketh his face to shine, and the boldnes of his face
shalbe changed.<note> Prou.17. 24. , Heb. the strength.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">I counsell
thee, to keepe the kings commandement, and that in regard of the
oath of God.</ab>

<fw>The kings power.</fw>
<ab n="3">Bee not
hastie to goe out of his sight: stand not in an euill thing, for he
doeth whatsoeuer pleaseth him.</ab>
<ab n="4">Where the
word of a king is, there is power: and who may say vnto him, What
doest thou?</ab>
<ab n="5">Whoso keepeth
the commandement, shall feele no euill thing: and a wise mans heart
discerneth both time and iudgement.<note> Heb. shall knew.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">¶
Because to euery purpose there is time, and iudgement; therefore
the misery of man is great vpon him.</ab>
<ab n="7">For hee
knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him, when it
shall be?<note> Or, how it shall be?</note></ab>
<ab n="8">There is no
man that hath power ouer the spirit to retaine the spirit; neither
hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in
that warre, neither shall wickednesse deliuer those that are giuen
to it.<note> Iob 14.5. , Or, casting of weapons.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">All this haue
I seene, and applied my heart vnto euery worke that is done vnder
the Sunne: there is a time wherein one man ruleth ouer another to
his owne hurt.</ab>
<ab n="10">And so I saw
the wicked buried, who had come, and gone from the place of the
Holy, and they were forgotten in the city, where they had so done:
this is also vanitie.</ab>
<ab n="11">Because
sentence against an euill worke is not executed speedily; therefore
the heart of the sonnes of men is fully set in them to doe
euill.</ab>
<ab n="12">¶
Though a sinner doe euill an hundred times, and his dayes be
prolonged; yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that
feare God, which feare before him.<note> Psal.37. 10,11,18, 19.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">But it shall
not be well with the wicked, neither shall hee prolong his dayes
which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.</ab>
<ab n="14">There is a
vanitie which is done vpon the earth, that there be iust men vnto
whom it happeneth according to the worke of the wicked: againe,
there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the worke of
the righteous: I said, that this also is vanitie.<note> Psa.73.13.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">Then I
commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing vnder the
Sunne, then to eate and to drinke, and to be merrie: for that shall
abide with him of his labour, the dayes of his life, which God
giueth him vnder the Sunne.<note> Cha.3.22.</note></ab>

<fw>All are alike.</fw>
<ab n="16">¶ When
I applied mine heart to know wisedome, and to see the busines that
is done vpon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor
night seeth sleepe with his eyes.)</ab>
<ab n="17">Then I
behelde all the worke of God, that a man cannot finde out the worke
that is done vnder the Sunne: because though a man labour to seeke
it out, yea further though a wise man thinke to know it, yet shall
hee not be able to finde it.</ab>
