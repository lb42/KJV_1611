<head>CHAP.
XXV.</head>
<head>1 The Prophet praiseth God, for his
iudgements, 6 for his sauing benefits, 9 and for his victorious
saluation.</head>

<ab n="1">O Lord, thou art
my God, I will exalt thee, I will praise thy Name; for thou hast
done wonderfull things; thy counsels of old are faithfulnesse and
trueth.</ab>
<ab n="2">For thou hast made
of a citie, an heape; of a defenced city, a ruine: a palace of
strangers, to be no citie, it shall neuer be built.</ab>
<ab n="3">Therefore shall
the strong people glorifie thee, the city of the terrible nations
shall feare thee.</ab>
<ab n="4">For thou hast bene
a strength to the poore, a strength to the needy in his distresse,
a refuge from the storme, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of
the terrible ones is as a storme against the wall.</ab>

<fw>Death swallowed.</fw>
<ab n="5">Thou shalt bring
downe the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; euen the
heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones
shalbe brought low.</ab>
<ab n="6">¶ And in this
mountaine shall the Lord of hostes make vnto all people a feast of
fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of
marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.</ab>
<ab n="7">And he wil destroy
in this mountaine the face of the couering cast ouer all people,
and the vaile that is spread ouer all nations.<note> Heb. swallow vp. , Hebr. couered.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">He will swallow vp
death in victorie, and the Lord God wil wipe away teares from off
al faces, and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off
all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it.<note> 1.Cor.15. 55 , Reuel.7. 17. and 21. 4.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">¶ And it
shalbe said in that day, Loe, this is our God, we haue waited for
him, and he will saue vs: this is the Lord, we haue waited for him,
we wil be glad, and reioyce in his saluation.</ab>
<ab n="10">For in this
mountaine shall the hand of the Lord rest, and Moab shalbe troden
downe vnder him, euen as straw is troden downe for the
dounghill.<note> Or, threshed. , Or, threshed in Madmenah.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And hee shall
spread foorth his hands in the midst of them, as hee that swimmeth
spreadeth foorth his hands to swimme: and hee shall bring downe
their pride together with the spoiles of their hands.</ab>
<ab n="12">And the fortresse
of the high fort of thy walles shall hee bring downe, lay low, and
bring to the ground, euen to the dust.</ab>
