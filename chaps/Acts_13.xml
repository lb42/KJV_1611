<head>1 Paul and Barnabas are chosen to
goe to the Gentiles. 7 Of Sergius Paulus, and Elymas the sorcerer.
14 Paul preacheth at Antioch, that Iesus is Christ. 42 The Gentiles
beleeue: 45 but the Iewes gainesay and blaspheme: 46 whereupon they
turne to the Gentiles. 48 As many as were ordained to life,
beleeued.</head>

<ab n="1">Nowe there
were in the Church that was at Antioch, certaine Prophets and
teachers: as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius
of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had bene brought vp with Herod the
Tetrarch, and Saul.<note> Or, Herods foster brother.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">As they
ministred to the Lord, and fasted, the holy Ghost said, Separate me
Barnabas and Saul, for the worke whereunto I haue called
them.</ab>
<ab n="3">And when they
had fasted and prayed, and laid their handes on them, they sent
them away.</ab>
<ab n="4">¶ So they
being sent forth by the holy Ghost, departed vnto Seleucia, and
from thence they sailed to Cyprus.</ab>
<ab n="5">And when they
were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the Synagogues of
the Iewes: and they had also Iohn to their Minister.</ab>
<ab n="6">And when they
had gone thorow the Ile vnto Paphos, they found a certaine
sorcerer, a false prophet, a Iewe, whose name was Bariesus:</ab>
<ab n="7">Which was with
the deputie of the countrey Sergius Paulus, a prudent man: who
called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to heare the word of
God.</ab>
<ab n="8">But Elymas the
sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them,
seeking to turne away the deputy from the faith.</ab>
<ab n="9">Then Saul (who
also is called Paul) filled with the holy Ghost, set his eyes on
him,</ab>
<ab n="10">And said, O full of
all subtilty and all mischiefe, thou child of the deuil, thou
enemie of all righteousnesse, wilt thou not cease to peruert the
right wayes of the Lord?</ab>
<ab n="11">And now behold, the
hand of the Lord is vpon thee, &amp; thou shalt be blind, not
seeing the Sunne for a season. And immediately there fell on him a
mist and a darkenes, and he went about, seeking some to lead him by
the hand.</ab>

<fw>Pauls sermon to the people.</fw>
<ab n="12">Then the Deputie
when he sawe what was done, beleeued, being astonished at the
doctrine of the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="13">Now when Paul and
his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia:
and Iohn departing from them, returned to Hierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="14">¶ But when
they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went
into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sate downe.</ab>
<ab n="15">And after the
reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue
sent vnto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye haue any word of
exhortation for the people, say on.</ab>
<ab n="16">Then Paul stood vp,
and beckning with his hand, said, Men of Israel, and ye that feare
God, giue audience.</ab>
<ab n="17">The God of this
people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when
they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arme
brought he them out of it.<note> Exod.1.1. , Exod.13. 14.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">And about the time
of fourtie yeeres suffered he their maners in the
wildernesse.<note> Exod.13. 16. , Gr [illegible Greek] perhaps, for [illegible Greek], as a nurse beareth or feedeth her childe, Deut.1. 31. 2.macc 7. 27, according to the Sept. and so Chrysost.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">And when he had
destroyed seuen nations in the land of Chanaan, he diuided their
land to them by lot:<note> Iosh.14. 1</note></ab>
<ab n="20">And after that he
gaue vnto them iudges, about the space of foure hundred and fifty
yeeres vntill Samuel the Prophet.<note> Iudg.3.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">And afterward they
desired a King, and God gaue vnto them Saul the sonne of Cis, a man
of the tribe of Beniamin, by the space of fourty yeres.<note> 1.Sam.8. 5.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">And when he had
remoued him, hee raised vp vnto them Dauid to be their king, to
whom also he gaue testimonie, and said, I haue found Dauid the
sonne of Iesse, a man after mine own heart, which shal fulfill all
my wil.<note> 1.Sam. 16 13. , Psal.89. 21.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">Of this mans seed
hath God, according to his promise, raised vnto Israel a Sauiour,
Iesus:<note> Esai.11. 1.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">When Iohn had first
preached before his coming, the baptisme of repentance to all the
people of Israel.<note> Mat.3.1.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">And as Iohn
fulfilled his course, he said, Whom thinke ye that I am? I am not
he. But behold, there commeth one after me, whose shooes of his
feete I am not worthy to loose.<note> Iohn 1.20</note></ab>

<fw>Pauls sermon to the people.</fw>
<ab n="26">Men and brethren,
children of the stocke of Abraham, and whosoeuer among you feareth
God, to you is the word of this saluation sent.</ab>
<ab n="27">For they that dwell
at Hierusalem, &amp; their rulers, because they knew him not, nor
yet the voices of the Prophets which are read euery Sabbath day,
they haue fulfilled them in condemning him.</ab>
<ab n="28">And though they
found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he
should be slaine.<note> Mat.27. 22.</note></ab>
<ab n="29">And when they had
fulfilled all that was written of him, they tooke him downe from
the tree, and layd him in a Sepulchre.</ab>
<ab n="30">But God raised him
frō the dead:<note> Mat. 28.6</note></ab>
<ab n="31">And he was seene
many dayes of them which came vp with him from Galilee to
Hierusalem, who are his witnesses vnto the people.</ab>
<ab n="32">And we declare vnto
you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made vnto the
fathers,</ab>
<ab n="33">God hath fulfilled
the same vnto vs their children, in that he hath raised vp Iesus
againe, as it is also written in the second Psalme: Thou art my
Sonne, this day haue I begotten thee.<note> Psal.2.7. heb.1.5.</note></ab>
<ab n="34">And as concerning
that he raised him vp from the dead, now no more to returne to
corruption, he said on this wise, I will giue you the sure mercies
of Dauid.<note> Esai.55.3. , Gre. [illegible Greek], holy or iust things, which word the Sept. both in the place of Esai 55.3. and in many others, vse for that which is in the Hebrew, Mercies.</note></ab>
<ab n="35">Wherfore he saith
also in another Psalme, Thou shalt not suffer thine holy one to see
corruption.<note> Psal.16. 11.</note></ab>
<ab n="36">For Dauid after he
had serued his owne generation by the will of God, fell on sleepe,
and was laide vnto his fathers, and saw corruption:<note> Or, after he had in his owne age serued the will of God. , 1.Kings 2.10.</note></ab>
<ab n="37">But hee whom God
raised againe, saw no corruption.</ab>
<ab n="38">¶ Be it knowen
vnto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is
preached vnto you the forgiuenesse of sinnes.</ab>
<ab n="39">And by him all
þt beleeue, are iustified from all things, from
which ye could not be iustified by the Law of Moses.</ab>
<ab n="40">Beware therefore,
least that come vpon you which is spoken of in the
Prophets,<note> Habac.1.5</note></ab>
<ab n="41">Behold, yee
despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I worke a worke in your
dayes, a worke which you shall in no wise beleeue, though a man
declare it vnto you.</ab>

<fw>Ordeined to life.</fw>
<ab n="42">And when the Iewes
were gone out of the Synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these
words might be preached to them the next Sabbath.<note> Or, in the weeke betweene, or in the Sabbath betweene.</note></ab>
<ab n="43">Now when the
Congregation was broken vp, many of the Iewes, and religious
Proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who speaking to them,
perswaded them to continue in the grace of God.</ab>
<ab n="44">¶ And the next
Sabbath day came almost the whole citie together to heare the word
of God.</ab>
<ab n="45">But when the Iewes
saw the multitudes, they were filled with enuie, and spake against
those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting, and
blaspheming.</ab>
<ab n="46">Then Paul and
Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of
God should first haue bene spoken to you: but seeing yee put it
from you, and iudge your selues vnworthy of euerlasting life, loe,
we turne to the Gentiles.</ab>
<ab n="47">For so hath the
Lord cōmanded vs, saying, I haue set thee to bee a light of
the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for saluation vnto the ends of
the earth.<note> Esay 49. 6.</note></ab>
<ab n="48">And when the
Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the
Lord: and as many as were ordeined to eternall life,
beleeued.</ab>
<ab n="49">And the word of the
Lord was published throughout all the region.</ab>
<ab n="50">But the Iewes
stirred vp the deuout and honourable women, and the chiefe men of
the citie, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and
expelled them out of their coasts.</ab>
<ab n="51">But they shooke off
the dust of their feete against them, and came vnto
Iconium.<note> Matth.10. 14.</note></ab>
<ab n="52">And the disciples
were filled with ioy, and with the holy Ghost.</ab>
