<head>CHAP.
LXI.</head>
<head>1 The Office of Christ. 4 The
forwardnesse, 7 and blessings of the faithfull.</head>

<ab n="1">The Spirit of the
Lord God is vpon me, because the Lord hath anointed me, to preach
good tidings vnto the meeke, hee hath sent me to binde vp the
broken hearted, to proclaime libertie to the captiues, and the
opening of the prison to them that are bound:<note> Luk.4.18</note></ab>
<ab n="2">To proclaime the
acceptable yere of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God,
to comfort all that mourne:</ab>
<ab n="3">To appoint vnto
them that mourne in Zion, to giue vnto them beautie for ashes, the
oyle of ioy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of
heauinesse, that they might be called trees of righteousnesse, the
planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.</ab>
<ab n="4">¶ And they
shall build the olde wastes, they shall raise vp the former
desolations, and they shall repaire the waste cities, the
desolations of many generations.<note> Chap. 58. 12.</note></ab>

<fw>The duetie of Watchmen.</fw>
<ab n="5">And strangers
shall stand and feed your flockes, and the sonnes of the alient
shalbe your plowmen, and your Uine-dressers.</ab>
<ab n="6">But ye shalbe
named the Priests of the Lord: men shall call you the ministers of
our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their
glory shall you boast your selues.<note> Chap. 60. 6.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">¶ For your
shame you shall haue double; and for confusion they shall reioyce
in their portion: therefore in their land they shal possesse the
double: euerlasting ioy shalbe vnto them.</ab>
<ab n="8">For I the Lord
loue Iudgement, I hate robbery for burnt offering, and I will
direct their worke in trueth, and I will make an euerlasting
Couenant with them.</ab>
<ab n="9">And their seed
shalbe knowen among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the
people: All that see them, shall acknowledge them, that they are
the seed which the Lord hath blessed.</ab>
<ab n="10">I will greatly
reioyce in the Lord, my soule shalbe ioyfull in my God: for he hath
clothed me with the garments of saluation, he hath couered me with
the robe of righteousnes, as a bridegrome decketh himselfe with
ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herselfe with her
iewels.<note> Heb. decketh as a priest.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">For as the earth
bringeth foorth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that
are sowen in it, to spring foorth: so the Lord God will cause
righteousnes and praise to spring forth before all the
nations.</ab>
