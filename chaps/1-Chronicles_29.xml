God.<note> Cha.22.5.</note></ab>

<fw>The Princes gifts.</fw>
<ab n="2">Now I haue

things to be made of gold, the siluer for things of siluer, and the
brasse for things of brasse, the yron for things of yron, and wood
for things of wood, onix stones, and stones to be set, glistering
stones, and of diuers colours, and all maner of precious stones,
and marble stones in abundance.</ab>
<ab n="3">Moreouer,
because I haue set my affection to the house of my God, I haue of
mine owne proper good, of gold and siluer, which I haue giuen to
the house of my God, ouer &amp; aboue all that I haue prepared for
the holy house:</ab>
<ab n="4">Euen three
thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seuen thousand
talents of refined siluer, to ouerlay the walles of the houses
withall.<note> 1.king.9. 28.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">The gold for
things of golde, and the siluer for things of siluer, and for all
maner of worke to be made by the hands of Artificers. And who then
is willing to consecrate his seruice this day vnto the
Lord?<note> Hebr. to fill his hand.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">¶ Then
the chiefe of the fathers and Princes of the tribes of Israel, and
the captaines of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers ouer
the Kings worke, offered willingly,</ab>
<ab n="7">And gaue for
the seruice of the house of God, of gold fiue thousand talents, and
ten thousand drammes: and of siluer, ten thousand talents: and of
brasse, eighteene thousand talents: and one hundred thousand
talents of yron.</ab>
<ab n="8">And they
with whom precious stones were found, gaue them to the treasure of
the house of the Lord, by the hand of Iehiel the
Gershonite.</ab>
<ab n="9">Then the
people reioyced, for that they offred willingly, because with
perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord: and Dauid the
King also reioyced with great ioy.</ab>
<ab n="10">¶
Wherefore Dauid blessed the Lord before all the Congregation: and
Dauid saide, Blessed bee thou, Lord God of Israel our father, for
euer and euer.</ab>
<ab n="11">Thine, O
Lord, is the greatnes, and the power, and the glory, &amp; the
victorie, and the maiestie: for all that is in the heauen &amp; in
the earth, is thine: thine is the kingdome, O Lord, and thou art
exalted as head aboue all.<note> Mat.6.13 1.tim.1.17. apoc. 5.13.</note></ab>

<fw>Dauids prayer.</fw>
<ab n="12">Both
riches, and honour come of thee, and thou reignest ouer all, and in
thine hand is power and might, and in thine hand it is to make
great, and to giue strength vnto all.</ab>
<ab n="13">Now
therefore, our God, wee thanke thee, and praise thy glorious
Name.</ab>
<ab n="14">But who am
I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so
willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of
thine owne haue we giuen thee.<note> Hebr. retaine or obtain strength , Hebr. of thine hand.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">For we are
strangers before thee, and soiourners, as were all our fathers: Our
dayes on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none
abiding.<note> Psal.39.12 and 90.9. heb.11.13. 1.pet.2.11. , Hebr. expectation.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">O Lord our
God, all this store that we haue prepared to build thee an house
for thine holy Name, commeth of thine hand, and is all thine
owne.</ab>
<ab n="17">I know
also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in
vprightnesse. As for me, in the vprightnes of mine heart I haue
willingly offered all these things: and now haue I seene with ioy,
thy people which are present here, to offer willingly vnto
thee.<note> Cha. 23.9 1.Sam.16.7 , Heb. found</note></ab>
<ab n="18">O Lord God
of Abraham, Isaac and of Israel our fathers, keepe this for euer in
the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and
prepare their heart vnto thee:<note> Or, stablish</note></ab>
<ab n="19">And giue
vnto Solomon my sonne a perfect heart to keepe thy Commaundements,
thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to doe all these things, and
to build the pallace, for the which I haue made prouision.</ab>
<ab n="20">¶ And
Dauid said to all the Congregation: Nowe blesse the Lord your God.
And all the Congregation blessed the Lord God of their fathers, and
bowed downe their heads, and worshipped the Lord, and the
King.</ab>
<ab n="21">And they
sacrificed sacrifices vnto the Lord, &amp; offered burnt offerings
vnto the Lord on the morrow after that day, euen a thousand
bullockes, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambes, with their
drinke offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all
Israel:</ab>
<ab n="22">And did
eate and drinke before the Lord on that day with great gladnesse,
and they made Solomon the sonne of Dauid King the second time, and
anointed him vnto the Lord to be the chiefe gouernour, and Zadok to
be Priest.<note> 1.King.1. 33.</note></ab>

<fw>Solomons royaltie.</fw>
<ab n="23">Then
Solomon sate on the throne of the Lord, as king in stead of Dauid
his father, and prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.</ab>
<ab n="24">And all the
princes and the mightie men, and all the sonnes likewise of king
Dauid, submitted themselues vnto Solomon the King.<note> Heb. gaue the hand vnder Solomon.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">And the
Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and
bestowed vpon him such royal maiestie, as had not bene on any king
before him in Israel.<note> 1.King.3. 13. 2.chro.1.12. eccles. 2.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="26">¶ Thus
Dauid the sonne of Iesse, reigned ouer all Israel.</ab>

<fw>Dauids death.</fw>
<ab n="27">And the
time that he reigned ouer Israel, was fourtie yeeres. Seuen yeeres
reigned hee in Hebron, and thirtie and three yeeres reigned hee in
Ierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="28">And he died
in a good old age, full of dayes, riches and honour: and Solomon
his sonne reigned in his stead.</ab>
<ab n="29">Now the
acts of Dauid the King first and last, behold, they are written in
the booke of Samuel the Seer, and in the booke of Nathan the
Prophet, and in the booke of Gad the Seer,<note> Or, historie. , Hebr. words.</note></ab>
<ab n="30">With all
his reigne and his might, and the times that went ouer him, and
ouer Israel, and ouer all the kingdomes of the countreys.</ab>
