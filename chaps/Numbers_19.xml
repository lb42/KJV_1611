<ab n="9">And a man that is
cleane, shall gather vp the ashes of the heifer, and lay them vp

<ab n="18">And a cleane

<fw>Miriam dieth.</fw>
<ab n="20">But the man that
shall bee vncleane, and shall not purifie himselfe, that soule

defiled the Sanctuary of the Lord, the water of separation hath not
beene sprinkled vpon him, he is vncleane.</ab>
<ab n="21">And it shall be
a perpetuall statute vnto them, that he that sprinkleth the water
of separation, shall wash his clothes: and he that toucheth the
water of separation, shall be vncleane vntill Euen.</ab>
