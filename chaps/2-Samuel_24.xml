<fw>Israel numbred.</fw>
<ab n="1">And againe the
anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and hee mooued Dauid
against them, to say, Goe, number Israel and Iudah.<note> Satan. See 1.Chron. 21.1.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">For the king
said to Ioab the captaine of the hoste, which was with him, Goe now
through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan euen to Beer-sheba, and
number ye the people, that I may know the number of the
people.<note> Or, compasse.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And Ioab sayde
vnto the King, Now the Lord thy God adde vnto the people (how many
soeuer they be) an hundred folde, and that the eyes of my lorde the
king may see it: but why doeth my lord the king delight in this
thing?</ab>
<ab n="4">Notwithstanding,
the kings word preuailed against Ioab, and against the captaines of
the hoste: and Ioab and the captaines of the host went out from the
presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</ab>
<ab n="5">¶ And they
passed ouer Iordane, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the
citie that lieth in the midst of the riuer of Gad, and toward
Iazer.<note> Or, valley.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">Then they came
to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-Hodshi; and they came to
Dan-Iaan, and about to Zidon,<note> Or, nether land newly inhabited.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">And came to the
strong holde of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hiuites, and of
the Canaanites: and they went out to the South of Iudah, euen to
Beer-sheba.</ab>
<ab n="8">So when they had
gone through all the land, they came to Ierusalem at the ende of
nine moneths, and twentie dayes.</ab>
<ab n="9">And Ioab gaue vp
the summe of the number of the people vnto the king, and there were
in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drewe the sword:
and the men of Iudah were fiue hundred thousand men.</ab>

<fw>Dauid repenteth, and
sacrificeth.</fw>
<ab n="10">¶ And
Dauids heart smote him, after that hee had numbred the people: and
Dauid sayde vnto the Lord, I haue sinned greatly in that I haue
done: and nowe I beseech thee, O Lord, take away the iniquitie of
thy seruant, for I haue done very foolishly.</ab>
<ab n="11">For when Dauid
was vp in the morning, the word of the Lord came vnto the Prophet
Gad Dauids Seer, saying,</ab>
<ab n="12">Goe and say
vnto Dauid, Thus saith the Lord, I offer thee three things; chuse
thee one of them, that I may doe it vnto thee.</ab>
<ab n="13">So Gad came to
Dauid, and told him, and said vnto him, Shall seuen yeeres of
famine come vnto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three moneths
before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be
three dayes pestilence in thy land? Now aduise, and see what
answere I shall returne to him that sent me.</ab>
<ab n="14">And Dauid saide
vnto Gad, I am in a great strait: let vs fall now into the hand of
the Lord (for his mercies are great,) and let me not fall into the
hand of man.<note> Or, many.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">¶ So the
Lord sent a pestilence vpon Israel, from the morning, euen to the
time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan euen to
Beersheba, seuentie thousand men.</ab>
<ab n="16">And when the
Angel stretched out his hand vpon Ierusalem to destroy it, the Lord
repented him of the euill, and said to the Angel that destroyed the
people, It is ynough: stay now thine hand. And the Angel of the
Lord was by the threshing place of Araunah the
Iebusite.<note> 1.Sam. 15.11.</note></ab>

<fw>Dauid repenteth, and
sacrificeth.</fw>
<ab n="17">And Dauid spake
vnto the Lord when he saw the Angel that smote the people, and
said, Loe, I haue sinned, and I haue done wickedly: but these
sheepe, what haue they done? Let thine hand, I pray thee, be
against mee, and against my fathers house.</ab>
<ab n="18">¶ And Gad
came that day to Dauid, and said vnto him, Goe vp, reare an Altar
vnto the Lord, in the threshing floore of Araunah the
Iebusite.</ab>
<ab n="19">And Dauid,
according to the saying of Gad, went vp, as the Lord
commanded.</ab>
<ab n="20">And Araunah
looked, and saw the King and his seruants comming on toward him:
and Araunah went out, and bowed himselfe before the King on his
face vpon the ground.</ab>
<ab n="21">And Araunah
said, Wherefore is my lord the King come to his seruant? and Dauid
saide, To buy the threshing floore of thee, to build an Altar vnto
the Lord, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</ab>
<ab n="22">And Araunah
said vnto Dauid, Let my lord the King take and offer vp what
seemeth good vnto him: Beholde, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice,
and threshing instruments, and other instruments of the oxen for
wood.</ab>
<ab n="23">All these
things did Araunah, as a king, giue vnto the King: and Araunah
saide vnto the King, The Lord thy God accept thee.</ab>
<ab n="24">And the King
said vnto Araunah, Nay, but I will surely buy it of thee at a
price: neither will I offer burnt offerings vnto the Lord my God,
of that which doeth cost mee nothing. So Dauid bought the threshing
floore, and the oxen, for fiftie shekels of siluer.</ab>
<ab n="25">Aud Dauid built
there an Altar vnto the Lord, and offered burnt offerings, and
peace offerings: so the Lord was intreated for the land, and the
plague was stayed from Israel.</ab>
