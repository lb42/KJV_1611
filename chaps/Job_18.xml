wicked.</head>

<ab n="1">Then answered
Bildad the Shuhite and said,</ab>
<ab n="2">How long will
it bee, ere you make an ende of words? Marke, and afterwards we
will speake.</ab>
<ab n="3">Wherefore are
wee counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?</ab>

<fw>The wickeds fall.</fw>
<ab n="4">He teareth
himselfe in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and
shall the rocke bee remooued out of his place?<note> Hebr. his soule.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">Yea, the light
of the wicked shalbe put out, and the sparke of his fire shall not
shine.</ab>
<ab n="6">The light
shalbe darke in his tabernacle, and his candle shalbe put out with
him.<note> Or, lampe.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">The steps of
his strength shall be straitened, and his owne counsell shall cast
him downe.</ab>
<ab n="8">For hee is cast
into a net by his owne feete, &amp; he walketh vpon a
snare.</ab>
<ab n="9">The grinne
shall take him by the heele, and the robber shall preuaile against
him.</ab>
<ab n="10">The snare is
laide for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the
way.<note> Heb. hidden.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">Terrours shall
make him afraid on euery side, and shall driue him to his
feete.<note> Heb. scatter him.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">His strength
shalbe hunger-bitten, and destruction shall be ready at his
side.</ab>
<ab n="13">It shall
deuoure the strength of his skinne: euen the first borne of death
shall deuoure his strength.<note> Heb. barres</note></ab>
<ab n="14">His confidence
shalbe rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the
king of terrours.<note> Cha.8.14. and 11. 20. psa. 112. 10. pro. 10.28.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">It shall dwell
in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be
scattered vpon his habitation.</ab>
<ab n="16">His rootes
shall be dryed vp beneath: and aboue shall his branch be cut
off.</ab>
<ab n="17">His
remembrance shall perish from the earth, and hee shall haue no name
in the streete.<note> Pro.2.22.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">He shall be
driuen from light into darkenesse, and chased out of the
world.<note> Heb. they shall driue him.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">Hee shall
neither haue sonne nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining
in his dwellings.</ab>
<ab n="20">They that come
after him shalbe astonied at his day, as they that went before,
were affrighted.<note> Or, liued with him. , Heb. layd holde on horror.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">Surely such
are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that
knoweth not God.</ab>
