<head>CHAP. II.</head>
<head>1 Gods wrath against Moab, 4 vpon
Iudah, 6 and vpon Israel. 9 God complaineth of their
vnthankefulnesse.</head>

<ab n="1">Thus sayth the
Lord, For three transgressions of Moab, and for foure, I wil not
turne away the punishment thereof, because hee burnt the bones of
the King of Edom into lime.<note> 2.Kings.3.27.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">But I will send
a fire vpon Moab, and it shall deuoure the palaces of Kerioth, and
Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of
the trumpet:</ab>
<ab n="3">And I will cut
off the iudge from the middest thereof, and wil slay all the
princes thereof with him, sayeth the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="4">¶ Thus
sayth the Lord, For three transgressions of Iudah, and for foure, I
will not turne away the punishment thereof; because they haue
despised the Law of the Lord, and haue not kept his Commandements,
and their lies caused them to erre, after the which their fathers
haue walked.</ab>
<ab n="5">But I will send
a fire vpon Iudah, and it shall deuoure the palaces of
Ierusalem.</ab>

<fw>Against Moab, Iudah, and
Israel.</fw>
<ab n="6">¶ Thus
sayth the Lord, For three transgressions of Israel, and for foure,
I will not turne away the punishment thereof; because they solde
the righteous for siluer, and the poore for a paire of
shooes:<note> Chap.8.8.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">That pant after
the dust of the earth on the head of the poore, and turne aside the
way of the meeke; and a man and his father will goe in vnto the
same maid, to profane my holy Name.<note> Or, young woman.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">And they lay
themselues downe vpon clothes laide to pledge, by euery Altar, and
they drinke the wine of the condemned in the house of their
God.<note> Or, such as haue fined or mulcted.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">¶ Yet
destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the
height of the Cedars, and hee was strong as the okes, yet I
destroyed his fruite from aboue, and his rootes from
beneath.<note> Num.21. 24. deut. 2. 31. iosh. 24.8.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">Also I brought
you vp from the land of Egypt, and ledde you fourtie yeeres through
the wildernesse, to possesse the land of the Amorite.<note> Exod. 12. 51.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">And I raised
vp of your sonnes for Prophets, and of your young men for
Nazarites. Is it not euen thus, O ye children of Israel, saith the
Lord ?</ab>
<ab n="12">But ye gaue
the Nazarites wine to drinke, and commaunded the Prophets, saying,
Prophecie not.<note> Cha.7.12.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Behold, I am
pressed vnder you, as a cart is pressed that is ful of
sheaues.<note> Or, I will presse your place as a cart full of sheaues presseth.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">Therefore the
flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not
strengthen his force, neither shall the mightie deliuer
himselfe:<note> Heb. his soule or life.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">Neither shall
hee stand that handleth the bow, and hee that is swift of foote,
shall not deliuer himselfe, neither shall hee that rideth the
horse, deliuer himselfe.</ab>
<ab n="16">And hee that
is couragious among the mighty, shall flee away naked in that day,
saith the Lord.<note> Heb. strong of his heart.</note></ab>
