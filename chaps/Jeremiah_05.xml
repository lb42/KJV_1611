<fw>Gods plagues.</fw>
<ab n="1">Runne yee to and
fro thorow the streetes of Ierusalem, and see now and knowe, and
seeke in the broad places thereof, if ye can finde a man, if there
be any that executeth iudgement, that seeketh the trueth, and I
will pardon it.</ab>
<ab n="2">And though they
say, The Lord liueth, surely they sweare falsely.</ab>
<ab n="3">O Lord, are not
thine eyes vpon the trueth? thou hast stricken them, but they haue
not grieued; thou hast consumed them, but they haue refused to
receiue correction: they haue made their faces harder then a rocke,
they haue refused to returne.<note> Isai.9.13. chap. 2. 30.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">Therefore I said,
Surely these are poore, they are foolish: for they know not the way
of the Lord, nor the iudgement of their God.</ab>
<ab n="5">I wil get me vnto
the great men, and will speake vnto them, for they haue knowen the
way of the Lord, and the iudgement of their God: but these haue
altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bondes.</ab>
<ab n="6">Wherfore a lyon
out of the forrest shall slay them, and a wolfe of the euenings
shall spoile them, a leopard shall watch ouer their cities: euery
one that goeth out thence shalbe torne in pieces, because their
transgressions are many, and their backeslidings are
increased.<note> Or, deserts. , Heb. are strong.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">¶ How shall
I pardon thee for this? thy children haue forsaken mee, and sworne
by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they
then committed adulterie, and assembled themselues by troupes in
the harlots houses.</ab>
<ab n="8">They were as fed
horses in the morning: euery one neighed after his neighbours
wife:<note> Ezek.22. 11.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">Shall I not visit
for these things, sayth the Lord, and shall not my soule bee
auenged on such a nation as this?</ab>
<ab n="10">¶ Goe yee
vp vpon her walles, and destroy, but make not a full ende: take
away her battlements, for they are not the Lords.</ab>
<ab n="11">For the house of
Israel, and the house of Iudah haue dealt very treacherously
against me, saith the Lord.</ab>

<fw>Gods word, fire.</fw>
<ab n="12">They haue belyed
the Lord, and said; It is not he, neither shall euill come vpon vs,
neither shal we see sword nor famine.<note> Isai. 28.15.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">And the prophets
shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be
done vnto them.</ab>
<ab n="14">Wherfore thus
saith the Lord God of Hostes; Because yee speake this word, behold,
I will make my words in thy mouth, fire, and this people wood, and
it shall deuoure them.<note> Cha. 1.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">Loe, I will
bring a nation vpon you from farre, O house of Israel, saith the
Lord: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation
whose language thou knowest not, neither vnderstandest what they
say.<note> Deut. 28. 49. cha. 1. 15. and 6. 22.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">Their quiuer is
as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men.</ab>
<ab n="17">And they shall
eate vp thine haruest and thy bread, which thy sonnes and thy
daughters should eate: they shall eate vp thy flockes and thine
heards: they shall eate vp thy vines and thy figtrees: they shall
impouerish thy fenced cities wherein thou trustedst, with the
sword.<note> Leu.26. 16. deut. 28.31.33.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Neuerthelesse in
those daies, saith the Lord, I will not make a full end with
you.<note> Cha.4.27.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">¶ And it
shall come to passe when yee shall say; Wherefore doth the Lord our
God all these things vnto vs? then shalt thou answere them; Like as
ye haue forsaken me, &amp; serued strange Gods in your land; so
shall yee serue strangers in a land that is not yours.<note> Cha.16.10 and 13.22.</note></ab>
<ab n="20">Declare this in
the house of Iacob, and publish it in Iudah saying;</ab>
<ab n="21">Heare now this,
O foolish people, and without vnderstanding, which haue eyes and
see not, which haue eares and heare not.<note> Isai. 6.9. matth. 13. 14. acts 28. 26. rom.11. 8. ioh.12. 40. , Heb. heart.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">Feare yee not
mee, saith the Lord ? Will yee not tremble at my presence, which
haue placed the sand for the bound of the sea, by a perpetuall
decree that it cannot passe it, and though the waues thereof tosse
themselues, yet can they not preuaile, though they roare, yet can
they not passe ouer it?<note> Iob.38. 10, 11. psal. 104.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">But this people
hath a reuolting and a rebellious heart: they are reuolted and
gone.</ab>

<fw>False prophets.</fw>
<ab n="24">Neither say they
in their heart; Let vs now feare the Lord our God, that giueth
raine, both the former and the later in his season: he reserueth
vnto vs the appointed weekes of the haruest.<note> Deut.11. 14.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">¶ Your
iniquities haue turned away these things, &amp; your sinnes haue
withholden good things from you.</ab>
<ab n="26">For among my
people are found wicked men: they lay waite as hee that setteth
snares, they set a trap, they catch men.<note> Or, they pry as foulers lie in waite.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">As a cage is
full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they
are become great, and waxen rich.<note> Or, coupe.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">They are waxen
fat, they shine: yea they ouerpasse the deedes of the wicked: they
iudge not the cause, the cause of the fatherlesse, yet they
prosper: and the right of the needy doe they not iudge.<note> Deut. 32. 15. , Isai.1. 23. zac. 7.10.</note></ab>
<ab n="29">Shall I not
visit for these things, saith the Lord ? shall not my soule be
auenged on such a nation as this?</ab>
<ab n="30">¶ A
wonderfull and horrible thing is committed in the land.<note> Or, astonishmen and filthinesse.</note></ab>
<ab n="31">The prophets
prophecie falsely, and the priests beare rule by their meanes, and
my people loue to haue it so: and what will yee doe in the end
therof?<note> Chap.14. 18. and 23. 25.26. ez. 13.6. , Or, take into their hands.</note></ab>
