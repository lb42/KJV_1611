<head>CHAP. XX.</head>
<head>1 Christ auoucheth his authoritie by
a question of Iohns Baptisme. 9 The parable of the Vineyard. 19 Of
giuing tribute to Cesar. 27 He conuinceth the Sadduces that denied
the resurrection. 41 How Christ is the sonne of Dauid. 45 Hee
warneth his disciples to beware of the Scribes.</head>

<ab n="1">And it came to
passe, that on one of those dayes, as he taught the people in the
Temple, and preached the Gospel, the chiefe Priests and the Scribes
came vpon him, with the Elders,<note> Matt.21. 23.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">And spake vnto
him, saying, Tell vs, by what authoritie doest thou these things?
or who is hee that gaue thee this authoritie?</ab>
<ab n="3">And hee
answered, and said vnto them, I will also aske you one thing, and
answere me.</ab>
<ab n="4">The Baptisme
of Iohn, was it from heauen, or of men?</ab>
<ab n="5">And they
reasoned with themselues, saying, If wee shall say, From heauen, he
will say, Why then beleeued yee him not?</ab>
<ab n="6">But and if we
say, Of men, all the people will stone vs: for they be perswaded
that Iohn was a Prophet.</ab>
<ab n="7">And they
answered, that they could not tell whence it was.</ab>
<ab n="8">And Iesus said
vnto them, Neither tell I you by what authoritie I doe these
things.</ab>
<ab n="9">Then began hee
to speake to the people this parable: A certaine man planted a
vineyard, and let it foorth to husbandmen, and went into a farre
countrey for a long time.<note> Mat.21. 33.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">And at the season,
hee sent a seruant to the husbandmen, that they should giue him of
the fruit of the vineyard, but the husbandmen beat him, and sent
him away emptie.</ab>

<fw>The Parable of the Vineyard let
out.</fw>
<ab n="11">And againe hee sent
another seruant, and they beat him also, and entreated him
shamefully, and sent him away emptie.</ab>
<ab n="12">And againe he sent
the third, and they wounded him also, &amp; cast him out.</ab>
<ab n="13">Then said the lord
of the vineyard, What shall I doe? I will send my beloued sonne: it
may be they will reuerence him when they see him.</ab>
<ab n="14">But when the
husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselues, saying, This is
þe heire, come, let vs kill him, that the
inheritance may be ours.</ab>
<ab n="15">So they cast him
out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord
of the vineyard doe vnto them?</ab>
<ab n="16">Hee shall come and
destroy these husbandmen, and shall giue the vineyard to others.
And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.</ab>
<ab n="17">And hee beheld
them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which
the builders reiected, the same is become the head of the
corner?<note> Psal. 118. 22.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Whosoeuer shall
fall vpon that stone, shalbe broken: but on whomsoeuer it shall
fall, it will grinde him to powder.</ab>
<ab n="19">¶ And the
chiefe Priests and the Scribes the same houre sought to lay hands
on him, and they feared the people: for they perceiued that he had
spoken this parable against them.</ab>
<ab n="20">And they watched
him, and sent foorth spies, which should faine themselues iust men,
that they might take holde of his words, that so they might deliuer
him vnto the power and authoritie of the gouernour.</ab>
<ab n="21">And they asked him,
saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly,
neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of
God truely.<note> Mat.22. 16. , Or, of a trueth.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">Is it lawfull for
vs to giue tribute vnto Cesar, or no?</ab>
<ab n="23">But he perceiued
their craftines, and said vnto them, Why tempt ye me?</ab>
<ab n="24">Shew me a peny:
whose image and superscription hath it? They answered, and said,
Cesars.<note> See Matt. 18.28.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">And he said vnto
them, Render therefore vnto Cesar the things which be Cesars, and
vnto God the things which be Gods.</ab>
<ab n="26">And they could not
take holde of his wordes before the people, and they marueiled at
his answere, and helde their peace.</ab>

<fw>Of the resurrection.</fw>
<ab n="27">¶ Then came to
him certaine of the Sadduces (which denie that there is any
resurrection) and they asked him,<note> Mat.22. 23.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">Saying, Master,
Moses wrote vnto vs, If any mans brother die, hauing a wife, and
hee die without children, that his brother should take his wife,
and raise vp seede vnto his brother.</ab>
<ab n="29">There were
therefore seuen brethren, and the first tooke a wife, and died
without children.</ab>
<ab n="30">And the second
tooke her to wife, and he died childlesse.</ab>
<ab n="31">And the third tooke
her, and in like maner the seuen also. And they left no children,
and died.</ab>
<ab n="32">Last of all the
woman died also.</ab>
<ab n="33">Therefore in the
resurrection, whose wife of them is she? for seuen had her to
wife.</ab>
<ab n="34">And Iesus
answering, said vnto them, The children of this world, marrie, and
are giuen in marriage:</ab>
<ab n="35">But they which
shall be accompted worthy to obtaine that world, and the
resurrection from the dead, neither marrie, nor are giuen in
marriage.</ab>
<ab n="36">Neither can they
die any more; for they are equall vnto the Angels, and are the
children of God, being the children of the resurrection.</ab>
<ab n="37">Now that the dead
are raised, euen Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the
Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isahac, and the God of
Iacob.<note> Exod.3.6.</note></ab>
<ab n="38">For he is not a God
of the dead, but of the liuing for all liue vnto him.</ab>
<ab n="39">¶ Then
certaine of the Scribes answering, said, Master, Thou hast well
said.</ab>
<ab n="40">And after that,
they durst not aske him any question at all.</ab>
<ab n="41">And he said vnto
them, How say they that Christ is Dauids sonne?<note> Mat.22. 42.</note></ab>
<ab n="42">And Dauid himselfe
saith in the booke of Psalmes, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou
on my right hand,</ab>
<ab n="43">Till I make thine
enemies thy footestoole.</ab>
<ab n="44">Dauid therefore
calleth him, Lord, how is he then his sonne?</ab>
<ab n="45">¶ Then in the
audience of all the people, he said vnto his disciples,</ab>

<fw>The poore widow.</fw>
<ab n="46">Beware of the
Scribes, which desire to walke in long robes, and loue greetings in
the markets, and the highest seates in the Synagogues, and the
chiefe roumes at feasts:<note> Mat.23.5.</note></ab>
<ab n="47">Which deuoure
widowes houses and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall
receiue greater damnation.</ab>
