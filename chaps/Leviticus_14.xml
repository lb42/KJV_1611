<ab n="34">When ye be

and I put the plague of leprosie in a house of the land of your
possession;</ab>
<ab n="35">And hee that
oweth the house shall come, and tell the Priest, saying, It seemeth
to me there is as it were a plague in the house:</ab>

<fw>Cleansing of the leprosie.</fw>
<ab n="36">Then the
Priest shall command that they emptie the house, before the Priest
goe into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not
made vncleane: and afterward the Priest shall goe in, to see the
house.<note> Or, prepare.</note></ab>
<ab n="37">And he shal
looke on the plague: and behold, if the plague be in the walls of
the house, with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight
are lower then the wall;</ab>
<ab n="38">Then the
Priest shall goe out of the house, to the doore of the house, and
shut vp the house seuen dayes.</ab>
<ab n="39">And the Priest
shall come againe the seuenth day, and shall looke: and behold, if
the plague bee spread in the walls of the house;</ab>
<ab n="40">Then the
Priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the
plague is, and they shall cast them into an vncleane place without
the Citie.</ab>
<ab n="41">And hee shall
cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall
powre out the dust that they scrape off, without the citie into an
vncleane place.</ab>
<ab n="42">And they shall
take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and
hee shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house.</ab>
<ab n="43">And if the
plague come againe, and breake out in the house, after that he hath
taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and
after it is plastered;</ab>
<ab n="44">Then the
Priest shall come and looke, and behold, if the plague bee spread
in the house, it is a fretting leprosie in the house: it is
vncleane.</ab>
<ab n="45">And he shall
breake downe the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof,
and all the morter of the house: and he shall cary them foorth out
of the city into an vncleane place.</ab>
<ab n="46">Moreouer, he
that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut vp, shalbe
vncleane vntill the Euen.</ab>
<ab n="47">And hee that
lieth in the house, shall wash his clothes: and hee that eateth in
the house, shall wash his clothes.</ab>
<ab n="48">And if the
Priest shall come in, and looke vpon it, and behold, the plague
hath not spread in the house, after the house was plastered: then
the Priest shall pronounce the house cleane, because the plague is
healed.<note> Hebr. in comming in, shall come in, &amp;c.</note></ab>

<fw>How to purge vncleane issues.</fw>
<ab n="49">And he shall
take to cleanse the house, two birds, and Cedar wood, and scarlet,
and hyssope.</ab>
<ab n="50">And he shall
kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessell, ouer running
water.</ab>
<ab n="51">And he shall
take the Cedar-wood and the hyssope, and the scarlet, and the
liuing bird, and dip them in the blood of the slaine bird, and in
the running water, and sprinkle the house seuen times.</ab>
<ab n="52">And he shall
clense the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running
water, and with the liuing bird, and with the Cedar wood, and with
the hyssope, and with the scarlet.</ab>
<ab n="53">But hee shall
let goe the liuing bird out of the citie into the open fields, and
make an atonement for the house: and it shall be cleane.</ab>
<ab n="54">This is the
law for all manner plague of leprosie and skall,<note> Chap. 13. 30.</note></ab>
<ab n="55">And for the
leprosie of a garment, and of an house,</ab>
<ab n="56">And for a
rising, and for a scabbe, and for a bright spot:</ab>
<ab n="57">To teach when
it is vncleane, and when it is cleane: this is the lawe of
leprosie.<note> Heb. in the day of the vncleane, and in the day of the cleane.</note></ab>
