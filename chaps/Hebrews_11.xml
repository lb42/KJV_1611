<head>CHAP. XI.</head>
<head>1 What faith is. 6 Without faith we
cannot please God. 7 The worthy fruits thereof in the Fathers of
old time.</head>

<ab n="1">Now faith is the
substance of things hoped for, the euidence of things not
seen.<note> Or, ground, or confidence</note></ab>
<ab n="2">For by it the
Elders obtained a good report.</ab>
<ab n="3">Through faith we
vnderstand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that
things which are seene were not made of things which doe
appeare.</ab>
<ab n="4">By faith Abel
offered vnto God a more excellent sacrifice then Kain, by which he
obtained witnes that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts:
and by it he being dead, yet speaketh.<note> Or, is yet spoken of.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">By faith Enoch
was translated, that he should not see death, and was not found,
because God had translated him: For before his translation he had
this testimonie, that he pleased God.</ab>

<fw>The force of faith.</fw>
<ab n="6">But without faith
it is impossible to please him: for hee that commeth to God, must
beleeue that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
diligently seeke him.</ab>
<ab n="7">By faith Noah
being warned of God of things not seene as yet, moued with feare,
prepared an Arke to the sauing of his house, by the which he
condemned the world, and became heire of the righteousnesse which
is by faith.<note> Or, being wary.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">By faith Abraham
when he was called to goe out into a place which hee should after
receiue for an inheritance, obeyed, and he went out, not knowing
whither he went.</ab>
<ab n="9">By faith hee
soiourned in the land of promise, as in a strange countrey,
dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Iacob, the heires with him
of the same promise.</ab>
<ab n="10">For hee looked
for a citie which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is
God.</ab>
<ab n="11">Through faith
also Sara her selfe receiued strength to conceiue seede, and was
deliuered of a child when she was past age, because she iudged him
faithful who had promised.</ab>
<ab n="12">Therfore sprang
there euen of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the starres
of the skie in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore
innumerable.</ab>
<ab n="13">These all died
in faith, not hauing receiued the promises, but hauing seene them a
farre off, and were perswaded of them, and embraced them, and
confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the
earth.<note> Gr. according to faith.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">For they that
say such things, declare plainly that they seeke a
countrey.</ab>
<ab n="15">And truly if
they had been mindfull of that countrey, from whence they came out,
they might haue had opportunitie to haue returned:</ab>
<ab n="16">But now they
desire a better countrey, that is, an heauenly: wherefore God is
not ashamed to bee called their God: for he hath prepared for
thÄ“ a city.</ab>
<ab n="17">By faith Abraham
when he was tried, offered vp Isaac: and he that had receiued the
promises, offered vp his onely begotten sonne,</ab>
<ab n="18">Of whom it was
said, That, in Isaac shall thy seed be called:<note> Or, To.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">Accounting that
God was able to raise him vp, euen from the dead: from whence also
he receiued him in a figure.</ab>

<fw>The force of faith.</fw>
<ab n="20">By faith Isaac
blessed Iacob and Esau concerning things to come.</ab>
<ab n="21">By faith Iacob
when hee was a dying, blessed both the sonnes of Ioseph, and
worshipped leaning vpon the top of his staffe.</ab>
<ab n="22">By faith, Ioseph
when hee died, made mention of the departing of the children of
Israel: and gaue commandement concerning his bones.<note> Or, remembred.</note></ab>
<ab n="23">By faith; Moses
when hee was borne was hid three moneths of his parents, because
they saw he was a proper childe, and they not afraid of the Kings
commandement.</ab>
<ab n="24">By faith Moses
when hee was come to yeeres, refused to bee called the sonne of
Pharaohs daughter,</ab>
<ab n="25">Chusing rather
to suffer affliction with the people of God, then to enioy the
pleasures of sinne for a season:</ab>
<ab n="26">Esteeming the
reproch of Christ greater riches then the treasures in Egypt: for
he had respect vnto the recompense of the reward.<note> Or, for Christ.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">By faith hee
forsooke Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he indured,
as seeing him who is inuisible.</ab>
<ab n="28">Through faith he
kept the Passeouer, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that
destroyed the first borne, should touch them.</ab>
<ab n="29">By faith they
passed through the red sea, as by drie land: which the Egyptians
assaying to do, were drowned.</ab>
<ab n="30">By faith the
walles of Iericho fell downe, after they were compassed about seuen
dayes.</ab>
<ab n="31">By faith the
harlot Rahab perished not with them that beleeued not, when shee
had receiued the spies with peace.<note> Or, that were disobedient.</note></ab>
<ab n="32">And what shall I
more say? for the time would faile mee to tell of Gideon, and of
Barak, and of Sampson, and of Iephthah, of Dauid also and Samuel,
and of the Prophets:</ab>
<ab n="33">Who through
faith subdued kingdomes, wrought righteousnesse, obteined promises,
stopped the mouthes of Lions,</ab>
<ab n="34">Quenched the
violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakenesse
were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the
armies of the aliens.</ab>

<fw>Gods chastening.</fw>
<ab n="35">Women receiued
their dead raised to life againe: and others were tortured, not
accepting deliuerance, that they might obtaine a better
resurrection.<note> 2.Macc. 7.7.</note></ab>
<ab n="36">And others had
triall of cruell mockings and scourgings, yea moreouer, of bonds
and imprisonment.</ab>
<ab n="37">They were
stoned, they were sawen asunder, were tempted, were slaine with the
sword: they wandered about in sheepskinnes, and goat skins, being
destitute, afflicted, tormented.</ab>
<ab n="38">Of whome the
world was not worthy: they wandered in deserts, and in mountains,
and in dennes and caues of the earth.</ab>
<ab n="39">And these all
hauing obtained a good report through faith, receiued not the
promise:</ab>
<ab n="40">God hauing
prouided some better thing for vs, that they without vs, should not
be made perfect.<note> Or, foreseene.</note></ab>
