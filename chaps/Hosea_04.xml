<fw>Priests reiected.</fw>
<ab n="1">Heare the
worde of the Lord, yee children of Israel: for the Lord hath a
controuersie with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no
trueth, nor mercie, nor knowledge of God in the land.<note> Mica.6.2.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">By swearing,
and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adulterie,
they breake out, and blood toucheth blood.<note> Hebr. bloods.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">Therefore
shall the land mourne, and euery one that dwelleth therein shall
languish, with the beastes of the field, and with the foules of
heauen, yea the fishes of the Sea also shall be taken away.</ab>
<ab n="4">Yet let no man
striue, nor reproue another: for this people are as they that
striue with the priest.</ab>
<ab n="5">Therefore
shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with
thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.<note> Heb. cut off</note></ab>
<ab n="6">¶ My
people are destroyed for lacke of knowledge: because thou hast
reiected knowledge, I will also reiect thee, that thou shalt be no
priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the lawe of thy God, I wil
also forget thy children.<note> Heb. cut off</note></ab>
<ab n="7">As they were
increased, so they sinned against me: therfore wil I change their
glory into shame.</ab>
<ab n="8">They eate vp
the sinne of my people, and they set their heart on their
iniquitie.<note> Heb. lift up their soule to their iniquitie.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And there
shall be like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their
wayes, and reward them their doings.<note> Isa.24.2. , Heb. visite vpon. , Heb. cause to returne.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">For they shall
eate, and not haue enough: they shall commit whordome, and shall
not increase, because they haue left off to take heed to the
Lord.</ab>
<ab n="11">Whoredome, and
wine, and newe wine take away the heart.</ab>
<ab n="12">¶ My people
aske counsel at their stocks, and their staffe declareth vnto them:
for the spirit of whordomes hath caused them to erre, and they haue
gone a whoring from vnder their God.</ab>
<ab n="13">They sacrifice vpon
the tops of the mountaines, and burne incense vpon the hilles vnder
okes and poplars, and elmes, because the shadowe thereof is good:
therefore your daughters shall commit whoredome, and your spouses
shall commit adulterie.</ab>

<fw>Israels pride.</fw>
<ab n="14">I will not punish
your daughters when they commit whordome, nor your spouses when
they commit adulterie: for themselues are separated with whores,
and they sacrifice with harlots: therfore the people that doth not
vnderstand, shall fall.<note> Or, shall I not? &amp;c. , Or, be punished.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">¶ Though thou
Israel play the harlot, yet let not Iudah offend, and come not ye
vnto Gilgal, neither goe ye vp to Beth-auen, nor sweare, The Lord
liueth:<note> 1.King. 12. 29.</note></ab>
<ab n="16">For Israel slideth
backe, as a backe sliding heifer: now the Lord will feede them as a
lambe in a large place.</ab>
<ab n="17">Ephraim is ioyned
to idoles: let him alone.</ab>
<ab n="18">Their drinke is
sowre: they haue committed whordome continually: her rulers with
shame doe loue, Giue ye.<note> Hebr. is gone. , Hebr. shields.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">The wind hath bound
her vp in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their
sacrifices.</ab>
