<head>CHAP.
XXII.</head>
<head>1 Hee exhorteth to repentance, with
promises and threats. 10 The iudgement of Shallum, 13 Of Iehoiakim,
20 and of Coniah.</head>

<ab n="1">Thus saith the
Lord, Goe downe to the house of the king of Iudah, and speake there
this word,</ab>
<ab n="2">And say, Heare
the word of the Lord, O king of Iudah, that sittest vpon the throne
of Dauid, thou, and thy seruants, and thy people that enter in by
these gates.</ab>
<ab n="3">Thus saith the
Lord, Execute ye iudgement and righteousnesse, and deliuer the
spoiler out of the hand of the oppressour: and doe no wrong, doe no
violence to the stranger, the fatherlesse, nor the widow, neither
shed innocent blood in this place.<note> Chap.21. 12.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">For if ye doe
this thing indeede, then shall there enter in by the gates of this
house, Kings sitting vpon the throne of Dauid, riding in charets
and on horses, he, and his seruants, and his people.<note> Chap.17. 25. , Hebr. for Dauid vpon his throne.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">But if yee will
not heare these words, I sweare by my selfe, saith the Lord, that
this house shall become a desolation.</ab>
<ab n="6">For thus saith
the Lord vnto the kings house of Iudah, Thou art Gilead vnto me,
and the head of Lebanon: yet surely I will make thee a wildernesse,
and cities which are not inhabited.</ab>
<ab n="7">And I will
prepare destroyers against thee, euery one with his weapons, and
they shall cut downe thy choise cedars, and cast them into the
fire.</ab>
<ab n="8">And many nations
shall passe by this citie, and they shall say euery man to his
neighbour, Wherefore hath the Lord done thus vnto this great
citie?<note> Deut.29. 24 1.kings 9.8.</note></ab>

<fw>The Kings duetie, and
prosperitie.</fw>
<ab n="9">Then they shall
answere, Because they haue forsaken the couenant of the Lord their
God, and worshipped other gods, and serued them.</ab>
<ab n="10">¶ Weepe ye
not for the dead, neither bemoane him, but weepe sore for him that
goeth away: for he shall returne no more, nor see his natiue
countrey.</ab>
<ab n="11">For thus saith
the Lord touching Shallum, the sonne of Iosiah king of Iudah which
reigned in stead of Iosiah his father, which went forth out of this
place, He shall not returne thither any more.</ab>
<ab n="12">But he shall
die in the place whither they haue led him captiue, and shal see
this land no more.</ab>
<ab n="13">¶ Woe vnto
him that buildeth his house by vnrighteousnesse, and his chambers
by wrong: that vseth his neighbours seruice without wages, and
giueth him not for his worke:<note> Leuit. 19. 13. deut.24 14, 15. habac.2.9.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">That saith, I
will build mee a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out
windowes, and it is sieled with cedar, and painted with
vermilion.<note> Hebr. through aired. , Or, my windowes.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">Shalt thou
reigne because thou closest thy selfe in cedar? did not thy father
eate and drinke, and doe iudgment and iustice, and then it was wel
with him?</ab>
<ab n="16">He iudged the
cause of the poore and needy, then it was well with him: was not
this to know me, saith the Lord ?</ab>
<ab n="17">But thine eyes
and thine heart are not but for thy couetousnesse, and for to shed
innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence to doe
it.<note> Or, incursion.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Therefore thus
saith the Lord concerning Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king of
Iudah, They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother, or ah
sister: they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah Lord, or ah his
glory.</ab>
<ab n="19">He shall be
buried with the buriall of an asse, drawen and cast forth beyond
the gates of Ierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="20">¶ Goe vp
to Lebanon, and crie, and lift vp thy voice in Bashan, and crie
from the passages: for all thy louers are destroyed.</ab>
<ab n="21">I spake vnto
thee in thy prosperitie, but thou saidest, I will not heare: this
hath bin thy maner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my
voice.<note> Heb. prosperities.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">The winde shall
eate vp all thy pastors, and thy louers shall goe into captiuitie,
surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy
wickednesse.</ab>

<fw>False pastours are threatned.</fw>
<ab n="23">O inhabitant of
Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the Cedars, how gracious shalt
thou bee when pangs come vpon thee, the paine as of a woman in
trauell?<note> Heb. inhabitresse.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">As I liue,
saith the Lord, though Coniah the sonne of Iehoiakim king of Iudah
were the signet vpon my right hand, yet would I plucke thee
thence.</ab>
<ab n="25">And I will giue
thee into the hand of them that seeke thy life, and into the hand
of them whose face thou fearest, euen into the hand of
Nebuchad-rezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the
Caldeans.</ab>
<ab n="26">And I will cast
thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another countrey
where ye were not borne, and there shall ye die.</ab>
<ab n="27">But to the land
whereunto they desire to returne, thither shall they not
returne.<note> Hebr. lift vp their minde.</note></ab>
<ab n="28">Is this man
Coniah a despised broken idole? is hee a vessell wherein is no
pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are
cast into a land which they know not?</ab>
<ab n="29">O earth, earth,
earth, heare the word of the Lord:</ab>
<ab n="30">Thus saith the
Lord, Write ye this man childlesse, a man that shall not prosper in
his dayes: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting vpon the
throne of Dauid, and ruling any more in Iudah.</ab>
