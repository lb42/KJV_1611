Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee.<note> Num.22. 5, 6.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">Neuerthelesse,
the Lord thy God would not hearken vnto Balaam: but the Lord thy

backe and couer that which commeth from thee.<note> Hebr. sittest downe.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">For the Lord
thy God walketh in the midst of thy campe, to deliuer thee, and to

thee.<note> Hebr. nakednesse of any thing.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">¶ Thou
shalt not deliuer vnto his master, the seruant which is escaped

<ab n="16">He shall

not oppresse him.<note> Hebr. is good for him.</note></ab>

in all that thou settest thine hand to, in the land whither thou
goest to possesse it.</ab>
<ab n="21">¶ When
thou shalt vow a vow vnto the Lord thy God, thou shalt not slacke
to pay it: for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee; and
it would be sinne in thee.<note> Eccles.5. 3.</note></ab>
