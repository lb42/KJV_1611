<head>CHAP. I.</head>
<head>Hee blesseth God for his manifold
spirituall graces: 10 shewing that the saluation in Christ is no
newes, but a thing prophesied of olde: 13 And exhorteth them
accordingly to a godly conuersation, forasmuch as they are now
borne anew by the word of God.</head>

<ab n="1">Peter an Apostle
of Iesus Christ, to the strangers scattred thorowout Pontus,
Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</ab>
<ab n="2">Elect, according
to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of
the Spirit vnto obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of Iesus
Christ: Grace vnto you and peace be multiplied.</ab>
<ab n="3">Blessed be the God
and Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, which according to his
abundant mercy, hath begotten vs againe vnto a liuely hope, by the
resurrection of Iesus Christ from the dead,<note> Gr. much.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">To an inheritance
incorruptible, and vndefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserued in
heauen for you,<note> Or, for vs.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">Who are kept by
the power of God through faith vnto saluation, ready to be reuealed
in the last time.</ab>
<ab n="6">Wherin ye greatly
reioyce, though now for a season (if neede bee) yee are in
heauinesse through manifolde temptations:</ab>
<ab n="7">That the triall of
your faith, being much more precious then of golde that perisheth,
though it bee tryed with fire, might be found vnto praise, and
honor, and glory, at the appearing of Iesus Christ:</ab>
<ab n="8">Whom hauing not
seene, yee loue, in whom though now ye see him not, yet beleeuing,
ye reioyce with ioy vnspeakeable, and full of glory,</ab>

<fw>Our price.</fw>
<ab n="9">Receiuing the ende
of your faith, euen the saluation of your soules:</ab>
<ab n="10">Of which
saluation the Prophets haue inquired, and searched diligently, who
prophesied of the grace that should come vnto you,</ab>
<ab n="11">Searching what,
or what maner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did
signifie, when it testified beforehand the suffrings of Christ, and
the glory that should follow.</ab>
<ab n="12">Unto whome it was
reuealed, that not vnto themselues, but vnto vs, they did minister
the things which are now reported vnto you, by them that haue
preached the Gospel vnto you, with the holy Ghost sent downe from
heauen, which things the Angels desire to looke into.</ab>
<ab n="13">Wherefore gird vp
the loynes of your minde, bee sober, and hope to the end, for the
grace that is to bee brought vnto you at the reuelation of Iesus
Christ:<note> Gr. perfectly.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">As obedient
children, not fashioning your selues according to the former lusts,
in your ignorance:</ab>
<ab n="15">But as hee which
hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all maner of
conuersation;</ab>
<ab n="16">Because it is
written, Be ye holy, for I am holy.<note> Leuit.11. 44. and 19.2. and 20.7.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">And if ye call on
the Father, who without respect of persons iudgeth according to
euery mans worke, passe the time of your soiourning here in
feare:</ab>
<ab n="18">For as much as ye
know that yee were not redeemed with corruptible things, as siluer
and golde, from your vaine conuersation receiued by tradition from
your fathers;</ab>
<ab n="19">But with the
precious blood of Christ, as of a Lambe without blemish and without
spot,</ab>
<ab n="20">Who verily was
foreordeined before the foundation of the world, but was manifest
in these last times for you.</ab>

<fw>The corner Stone.</fw>
<ab n="21">Who by him do
beleeue in God that raised him vp from the dead, and gaue him
glorie, that your faith and hope might be in God.</ab>
<ab n="22">Seeing yee haue
purified your soules in obeying the truth through the Spirit, vnto
vnfained loue of the brethren: see that ye loue one another with a
pure heart feruently,</ab>
<ab n="23">Being borne
againe, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word
of God which liueth and abideth for euer.</ab>
<ab n="24">For all flesh is
as grasse, and all the glory of man as the flowre of grasse: the
grasse withereth, and the flowre thereof falleth away.<note> Or, for that</note></ab>
<ab n="25">But the word of
the Lord endureth for euer: &amp; this is the word which by the
Gospel is preached vnto you.</ab>
