lay wait to kil him: 29 So doe the Grecians, but hee escapeth both.
31 The Church hauing rest, Peter healeth Æneas of the palsie,
36 and restoreth Tabitha to life.</head>

<ab n="1">And Saul yet
breathing out threatnings &amp; slaughter against the disciples of
the Lord, went vnto the high Priest,</ab>
<ab n="2">And desired of
him letters to Damascus, to the Synagogues, that if hee found any
of this way, whether they were men or women, hee might bring them
bound vnto Hierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="3">And as he
iourneyed he came neere Damascus, and suddenly there shined round
about him a light from heauen.</ab>
<ab n="4">And he fel to
the earth, and heard a voice saying vnto him, Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou me?</ab>
<ab n="5">And he said,
Who art thou Lord? And the Lord said, I am Iesus whom thou
persecutest: It is hard for thee to kicke against the
prickes.</ab>

<fw>The conuersion of Saul.</fw>
<ab n="6">And he
trembling and astonished, said, Lord, what wilt thou haue mee to
doe? And the Lord said vnto him, Arise, and goe into the citie, and
it shall be told thee what thou must doe.</ab>
<ab n="7">And the men
which iourneyed with him, stood speechlesse, hearing a voice, but
seeing no man.</ab>
<ab n="8">And Saul arose
from the earth, and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but
they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.</ab>
<ab n="9">And he was
three dayes without sight, and neither did eate, nor
drinke.</ab>
<ab n="10">¶ And
there was a certaine disciple at Damascus, named Ananias, and to
him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am
here, Lord.</ab>
<ab n="11">And the Lord
said vnto him, Arise, and goe into the street, which is called
Straight, and inquire in the house of Iudas, for one called Saul of
Tarsus: for behold, he prayeth,</ab>
<ab n="12">And hath seene
in a vision a man named Ananias, comming in, and putting his hand
on him, that he might receiue his sight.</ab>
<ab n="13">Then Ananias
answered, Lord, I haue heard by many of this man, how much euill
hee hath done to thy Saints at Hierusalem:</ab>
<ab n="14">And here he
hath authoritic from the chiefe Priests, to binde all that call on
thy Name.</ab>
<ab n="15">But the Lord
said vnto him, Goe thy way: for hee is a chosen vessell vnto me, to
beare my Name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and the children of
Israel.</ab>
<ab n="16">For I will
shew him how great things hee must suffer for my Names
sake.</ab>
<ab n="17">And Ananias
went his way, and entred into the house, and putting his hands on
him, said, Brother Saul, the Lord (euen Iesus that appeared vnto
thee in the way as thou camest) hath sent me, that thou mightest
receiue thy sight, and be filled with the holy Ghost.</ab>
<ab n="18">And immediatly
there fell from his eyes as it had bene scales, and he receiued
sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.</ab>
<ab n="19">And when hee
had receiued meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certaine
dayes with the disciples which were at Damascus.</ab>
<ab n="20">And
straightway hee preached Christ in the Synagogues, that hee is the
Sonne of God.</ab>

<fw>Aeneas healed.</fw>
<ab n="21">But all that
heard him, were amazed, and said, Is not this he that destroyed
them which called on this Name in Hierusalem, and came hither for
that intent that he might bring them bound vnto the chiefe
Priests?</ab>
<ab n="22">But Saul
increased the more in strength, and confounded the Iewes which
dwelt at Damascus, proouing that this is very Christ.</ab>
<ab n="23">¶ And
after that many dayes were fulfilled, the Iewes tooke counsel to
kill him.</ab>
<ab n="24">But their
laying awaite was knowen of Saul: and they watched the gates day
and night to kill him.<note> 2.Cor. 11 32.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">Then the
disciples tooke him by night, and let him downe by the wall in a
basket.</ab>
<ab n="26">And when Saul
was come to Hierusalem, he assayed to ioyne himselfe to the
disciples, but they were all afraid of him, and beleeued not that
he was a disciple.</ab>
<ab n="27">But Barnabas
tooke him, and brought him to the Apostles, and declared vnto them
how hee had seene the Lord in the way, and that hee had spoken to
him, and how hee had preached boldly at Damascus in the Name of
Iesus.</ab>
<ab n="28">And he was
with them comming in, and going out at Hierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="29">And he spake
boldly in the Name of the Lord Iesus, and disputed against the
Grecians: but they went about to slay him.</ab>
<ab n="30">Which when the
brethren knewe, they brought him downe to Cesarea, and sent him
foorth to Tarsus.</ab>
<ab n="31">Then had the
Churches rest thorowout all Iudea, and Galilee, and Samaria, and
were edified, and walking in the feare of the Lord, and in the
comfort of the holy Ghost, were multiplied.</ab>
<ab n="32">¶ And it
came to passe, as Peter passed thorowout all quarters, he came
downe also to the Saints, which dwelt at Lydda.</ab>
<ab n="33">And there he
found a certaine man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight
yeeres, and was sicke of the palsie.</ab>
<ab n="34">And Peter said
vnto him, Aeneas, Iesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make
thy bed. And he arose immediately.</ab>
<ab n="35">And all that
dwelt at Lydda, and Saron, saw him, and turned to the Lord.</ab>

<fw>Tabitha raised.</fw>
<ab n="36">¶ Now
there was at Ioppa a certain disciple, named Tabitha, which by
interpretation is called Dorcas: This woman was full of good works,
and almes deeds, which she did.</ab>
<ab n="37">And it came to
passe in those dayes that she was sicke, and died: whome when they
had washed, they laid her in an vpper chamber.</ab>
<ab n="38">And forasmuch
as Lydda was nigh to Ioppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter
was there, they sent vnto him two men, desiring him that he would
not delay to come to them.<note> Or, be grieued.</note></ab>
<ab n="39">Then Peter
arose and went with them: when he was come, they brought him into
the vpper chamber: And all the widowes stood by him weeping, and
shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while shee was
with them.</ab>
<ab n="40">But Peter put
them all forth, and kneeled downe, and prayed, and turning him to
the body, said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes, and when
she saw Peter, she sate vp.</ab>
<ab n="41">And he gaue
her his hand, and lift her vp: and when hee had called the Saints
&amp; widowes, presented her aliue.</ab>
<ab n="42">And it was
knowen thorowout all Ioppa, and many beleeued in the Lord.</ab>
<ab n="43">And it came to
passe, that he taried many dayes in Ioppa, with one Simon a
Tanner.</ab>
