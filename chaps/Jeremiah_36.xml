<head>CHAP.
XXXVI.</head>
<head>1 Ieremiah causeth Baruch to write
his prophecie, 5 and publikely ro reade it. 11 The Princes hauing
intelligence thereof by Michaiah, send Iehudi to fetch the roule
and reade it. 19 They will Baruch to hide himselfe and Ieremiah. 20
The king Iehoiakim being certified thereof, heareth part of it, and
burneth the roule. 27 Ieremiah denounceth his iudgement. 32 Baruch
writeth a newe copie.</head>

<ab n="1">And it came to
passe in the fourth yeere of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king of
Iudah, that this word came vnto Ieremiah from the Lord,
saying;</ab>
<ab n="2">Take thee a
roule of a booke, and write therein all the words that I haue
spoken vnto thee against Israel, and against Iudah, &amp; against
all the nations, from the day I spake vnto thee, frō the dayes
of Iosiah, euen vnto this day.<note> Cha.25.3</note></ab>
<ab n="3">It may be that
the house of Iudah will heare all the euil which I purpose to doe
vnto them; that they may returne euery man from his euill way, that
I may forgiue their iniquitie, and their sinne.</ab>
<ab n="4">Then Ieremiah
called Baruch the sonne of Neriah, and Baruch wrote from the mouth
of Ieremiah all the words of the Lord, which he had spoken vnto
him, vpon a roule of a booke.</ab>
<ab n="5">And Ieremiah
commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut vp, I cannot goe into the house
of the Lord.</ab>

<fw>Baruch writeth, and readeth a
roule.</fw>
<ab n="6">Therefore goe
thou and reade in the roule, which thou hast written from my mouth,
the wordes of the Lord in the eares of the people in the Lords
house vpon the fasting day: and also thou shalt reade them in the
eares of all Iudah, that come out of their cities.</ab>
<ab n="7">It may bee they
will present their supplication before the Lord, and will returne
euery one from his euill way; for great is the anger and the furie
that the Lord hath pronounced against this people.<note> Heb. their supplication shall fall.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">And Baruch the
sonne of Neriah did according to all that Ieremiah the Prophet
commanded him, reading in the booke the wordes of the Lord, in the
Lords house.</ab>
<ab n="9">And it came to
passe in the fifth yeere of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king of
Iudah, in the ninth moneth, that they proclaimed a fast before the
Lord to all the people in Ierusalem, &amp; to all the people that
came from the cities of Iudah vnto Ierusalem.</ab>
<ab n="10">Then read
Baruch in the booke, the wordes of Ieremiah in the house of the
Lord, in the chamber of Gemariah the sonne of Shaphan the scribe,
in the higher court at the entry of the newe gate of the Lords
house, in the eares of all the people.<note> Or, doore. , Chap. 26. 10.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">¶ When
Michaiah the sonne of Gemariah the sonne of Shaphan had heard out
of the booke, all the words of the Lord;</ab>
<ab n="12">Then hee went
downe into the kings house into the scribes chamber, and loe, all
the princes sate there, euen Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the
sonne of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the sonne of Achbor, and Gemariah
the sonne of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the sonne of Hananiah, and all
the princes.</ab>
<ab n="13">Then Michaiah
declared vnto them all the words that hee had heard when Baruch
read the booke in the eares of the people.</ab>
<ab n="14">Therefore all
the princes sent Iehudi the sonne of Nethaniah, the sonne of
Shelemiah, the sonne of Cushi, vnto Baruch, saying; Take in thine
hand the roule wherein thou hast read in the eares of the people,
and come. So Baruch the sonne of Neriah took the roule in his hand,
and came vnto them.</ab>
<ab n="15">And they sayde
vnto him, Sit downe now and read it in our eares. So Baruch read it
in their eares.</ab>

<fw>The roule burnt.</fw>
<ab n="16">Now it came to
passe when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one
and other, and sayd vnto Baruch, Wee will surely tell the King of
all these words.</ab>
<ab n="17">And they asked
Baruch, saying, Tell vs now, How diddest thou write all these words
at his mouth?</ab>
<ab n="18">Then Baruch
answered them, Hee pronounced all these words vnto me with his
mouth, and I wrote them with inke in the Booke.</ab>
<ab n="19">Then said the
Princes vnto Baruch, Go hide thee, thou and Ieremiah, and let no
man know where yee bee.</ab>
<ab n="20">¶ And they
went in to the King into the Court, bnt they layed vp the roule in
the chamber of Elishama the Scribe, and told all the words in the
eares of the king.</ab>
<ab n="21">So the king
sent Iehudi to fet the roule, and hee tooke it out of Elishama the
scribes chamber, and Iehudi read it in the eares of the king, and
in the eares of all the princes which stood beside the
king.</ab>
<ab n="22">Now the king
sate in the winter house, in the ninth moneth, &amp; there was a
fire on the hearth burning before him.</ab>
<ab n="23">And it came to
passe that when Iehudi had read three or foure leaues, he cut it
with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the
hearth, vntill all the roule was consumed in the fire that was on
the hearth.</ab>
<ab n="24">Yet they were
not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of
his seruants that heard all these words.</ab>
<ab n="25">Neuerthelesse
Elnathan, and Delaiah &amp; Gemariah had made intercession to the
king that he would not burne the roule, but he would not heare
them.</ab>
<ab n="26">But the king
commaunded Ierahmeel the sonne of Hammelech, and Seraiah the sonne
of Azriel, &amp; Shelennah the sonne of Abdiel, to take Baruch the
scribe, and Ieremiah the Prophet: but the Lord hid
them.<note> Or, of the king.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">¶ Then the
word of the Lord came to Ieremiah (after that the king had burnt
the roule and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of
Ieremiah) saying;</ab>
<ab n="28">Take thee
againe another roule, and write in it all the former words that
were in the first roule, which Iehoiakim the king of Iudah hath
burnt.</ab>

<fw>Another written.</fw>
<ab n="29">And thou shalt
say to Iehoiakim king of Iudah, Thus sayth the Lord, Thou hast
burnt this roule, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying,
The king of Babylon shall certainely come and destroy this land,
and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?</ab>
<ab n="30">Therefore thus
saith the Lord of Iehoiakim king of Iudah; He shall haue none to
sit vpon the throne of Dauid, and his dead body shall be cast out
in the day to the heate, and in the night to the frost.<note> Chap.22.19.</note></ab>
<ab n="31">And I will
punish him and his seede, and his seruants for their iniquitie, and
I will bring vpon them, and vpon the inhabitants of Ierusalem, and
vpon the men of Iudah all the euill that I haue pronounced against
them: but they hearkened not.<note> Heb. visit vpon.</note></ab>
<ab n="32">¶ Then
tooke Ieremiah another roule, and gaue it to Baruch the scribe the
sonne of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Ieremiah, all
the words of the booke which Iehoiakim king of Iudah had burnt in
the fire, and there were added besides vnto them, many like
words.<note> Heb. as they.</note></ab>
