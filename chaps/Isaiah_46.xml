<head>CHAP.
XLVI.</head>
<head>1 The idoles of Babylon could not
saue themselues. 3 God saueth his people to the end. Idoles are not
comparable to God for power, 12 or present saluation.</head>

<ab n="1">Bel boweth downe,
Nebo stoupeth, their idoles were vpon the beasts, and vpon the
cattell: your carriages were heauie loaden, they are a burden to
the wearie beast.</ab>
<ab n="2">They stoupe, they
bow downe together, they could not deliuer the burden, but
themselues are gone into captiuitie.<note> Hebr. their soule.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">¶ Hearken
vnto me, O house of Iacob, and al the remnant of the house of
Israel, which are borne by me, from the belly, which are caried
from the wombe.</ab>
<ab n="4">And euen to your
old age I am he, and euen to hoare haires will I cary you: I haue
made, and I will beare, euen I wil cary and wil deliuer
you.</ab>
<ab n="5">¶ To whom wil
ye liken me, and make me equall, and compare me, that we may be
like?<note> Chap. 40. 18,25.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">They lauish gold
out of the bagge, and weigh siluer in the balance, and hire a
goldsmith, and hee maketh it a god: they fall downe, yea they
worship.</ab>
<ab n="7">They beare him
vpon the shoulder, they cary him and set him in his place, and hee
standeth; from his place shall he not remooue: yea one shall cry
vnto him, yet can he not answere, nor saue him out of his
trouble.</ab>
<ab n="8">Remember this, and
shew your selues men: bring it againe to minde, O ye
transgressours.</ab>
<ab n="9">Remember the
former things of old, for I am God, and there is none else, I am
God, and there is none like me,</ab>
<ab n="10">Declaring the end
from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not
yet done, saying, My counsell shall stand, and I wil doe all my
pleasure:<note> Psal.33. 11. pro. 19. 21. and 21. 30. hebr.6. 17.</note></ab>

<fw>Babylons pride.</fw>
<ab n="11">Calling a
rauenous bird from the East, the man that executeth my counsell
from a farre countrey; yea I haue spoken it, I will also bring it
to passe, I haue purposed it, I will also doe it.<note> Hebr. the man of my counsel.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">¶ Hearken
vnto me, ye stout hearted, that are farre from
righteousnesse.</ab>
<ab n="13">I bring neere my
righteousnesse: it shall not bee farre off, and my saluation shall
not tarie; and I wil place saluation in Zion for Israel my
glorie.</ab>
