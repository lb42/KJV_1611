keepe thy flocke.</ab>
<ab n="32">I will passe
through all thy flocke to day, remoouing from thence all the
speckled and spotted cattell: and all the browne cattell among the
sheepe, and the spotted and speckled among the goates, and of such
shalbe my hire.</ab>
<ab n="33">So shall my
righteousnesse answere for mee in time to come, when it shall come
for my hire, before thy face: euery one that is not speckled and
spotted amongst the goates, and browne amongst the sheepe, that
shalbe counted stollen with me.<note> Hebr. to morrow.</note></ab>
<ab n="34">And Laban saide,
Beholde, I would it might bee according to thy word.</ab>
<ab n="35">And he remoued

and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appeare which
was in the rods.</ab>
<ab n="38">And he set the
rods which he had pilled, before the flockes in the gutters in the
watering troughes when the flocks came to drinke, that they should
conceiue when they came to drinke.</ab>
<ab n="39">And the flockes
conceiued before the rods, and brought forth cattell ringstraked,
speckled and spotted.</ab>
<ab n="40">And Iacob did
separate the lambes, and set the faces of the flockes toward the
ring-straked, and all the browne in the flocke of Laban: and he put
his owne flocks by themselues, and put them not vnto Labans
cattell.</ab>
<ab n="41">And it came to
passe whensoeuer the stronger cattell did conceiue, that Iacob layd
the rods before the eyes of the cattell in the gutters, that they
might conceiue among the rods.</ab>
<ab n="42">But when the
cattel were feeble, hee put them not in: so the feebler were
Labans, and the stronger Iacobs.</ab>
