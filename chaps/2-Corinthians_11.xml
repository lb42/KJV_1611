<head>CHAP. XI.</head>
<head>1 Out of his ielousie ouer the
Corinthians, who seemed to make more account of the false apostles,
then of him, he entreth into a forced commendation of himselfe, 5
of his equalitie with the chiefe Apostles, 7 of his preaching the
Gospel to them freely, and without any their charge, 13 shewing
that hee was not inferiour to those deceitfull workers, in any
legall prerogatiue, 13 and in the seruice of Christ, and in all
kind of sufferings for his ministery, farre superiour.</head>

<ab n="1">Would to
God you could beare with mee a little in my folly, &amp; in deede
beare with me.<note> Or, you do beare with me.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">For I am
iealous ouer you with godly iealousie, for I haue espoused you to
one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to
Christ.</ab>
<ab n="3">But I feare
lest by any meanes, as the Serpent beguiled Eue through his
subtilty, so your mindes should bee corrupted from the simplicitie
that is in Christ.</ab>
<ab n="4">For if he
that commeth preacheth another Iesus whome wee haue not preached,
or if yee receiue another spirit, which ye haue not receiued, or
another Gospel, which ye haue not accepted, yee might well beare
with him.</ab>
<ab n="5">For, I
suppose, I was not a whit behinde the very chiefest
Apostles.</ab>
<ab n="6">But though
I be rude in speach, yet not in knowledge; but we haue bene
throughly made manifest among you in all things.</ab>
<ab n="7">Haue I
committed an offence in abasing my selfe, that you might be
exalted, because I haue preached to you the Gospel of God
freely?</ab>
<ab n="8">I robbed
other Churches, taking wages of them to doe you seruice.</ab>

<fw>Angel of light.</fw>
<ab n="9">And when I
was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: For
that which was lacking to mee, the brethren which came from
Macedonia supplied, and in all things I haue kept my selfe from
being burthensome to you, and so will I keepe my selfe.</ab>
<ab n="10">As the
trueth of Christ is in mee, no man shall stop mee of this boasting
in the regions of Achaia.<note> Gr. this boasting shal not be stopped in me.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">Wherefore?
because I loue you not? God knoweth.</ab>
<ab n="12">But what I
doe, that I wil doe, that I may cut off occasion from them which
desire occasion, that wherein they glory, they may bee found euen
as we.</ab>
<ab n="13">For such
are false Apostles, deceitfull workers, transforming themselues
into the Apostles of Christ.</ab>
<ab n="14">And no
marueile, for Sathan himselfe is transformed into an Angel of
light.</ab>
<ab n="15">Therefore
it is no great thing if his ministers also bee transformed as the
ministers of righteousnesse, whose end shall be according to their
workes.</ab>
<ab n="16">I say
againe, Let no man thinke mee a foole; if otherwise, yet as a foole
receiue me, that I may boast my selfe a little.<note> Or, suffer.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">That which
I speake, I speake it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly
in this confidence of boasting.</ab>
<ab n="18">Seeing
that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.</ab>
<ab n="19">For ye
suffer fooles gladly, seeing ye your selues are wise.</ab>
<ab n="20">For ye
suffer if a man bring you into bondage, if a man deuoure you, if a
man take of you, if a man exalt himselfe, if a man smite you on the
face.</ab>
<ab n="21">I speake
as concerning reproch, as though we had bene weake: howbeit,
wherein soeuer any is bold, I speake foolishly, I am bold
also.</ab>
<ab n="22">Are they
Hebrewes? so am I: are they Israelites? so am I: are they the seed
of Abraham? so am I:</ab>
<ab n="23">Are they
ministers of Christ? I speake as a foole, I am more: in labors more
abundant: in stripes aboue measure: in prisons more frequent: in
deaths oft.</ab>
<ab n="24">Of the
Iewes fiue times receiued I forty stripes saue one.<note> Deut.25. 3.</note></ab>
<ab n="25">Thrice was
I beaten with rods, once was I stoned: thrice I suffered
shipwracke: a night and a day I haue bene in the deepe.</ab>

<fw>Pauls afflictions.</fw>
<ab n="26">In
iourneying often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in
perils by my owne countreymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils
in the citie, in perils in the wildernesse, in perils in the sea,
in perils among false brethren,</ab>
<ab n="27">In
wearinesse and painfulnesse, in watchings often, in hunger &amp;
thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakednes.</ab>
<ab n="28">Besides
those things that are without, that which commeth vpon me dayly,
the care of all the Churches.</ab>
<ab n="29">Who is
weake, and I am not weake? who is offended, and I burne
not?</ab>
<ab n="30">If I must
needes glory, I will glory of the things which concerne mine
infirmities.</ab>
<ab n="31">The God
and Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, which is blessed for euermore,
knoweth that I lie not.</ab>
<ab n="32">In
Damascus the gouernour vnder Aretas the King, kept the citie with a
garison, desirous to apprehend mee.</ab>
<ab n="33">And
through a window in a basket was I let downe, by the wall, and
escaped his hands.</ab>
