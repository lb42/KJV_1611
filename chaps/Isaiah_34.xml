nations to heare, and hearken ye people: let the earth heare, and
all that is therein, the world, and all things that come forth of
it.<note> Hebr. the fulnes thereof.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">For the
indignation of the Lord is vpon all nations, and his furie vpon all
their armies: hee hath vtterly destroyed them, he hath deliuered
them to the slaughter.</ab>
<ab n="3">Their slaine also
shalbe cast out, and their stinke shall come vp out of their
carkeises, and the mountaines shalbe melted with their
blood.</ab>
<ab n="4">And all the hoste
of heauen shalbe dissolued, and the heauens shalbe rouled together
as a scrole: and all their hoste shall fall downe as the leafe
falleth off from the Uine, and as a falling figge from the figge
tree.<note> Reuel.6. 14. , Reuel.6. 13.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">For my sword shall
bee bathed in heauen: beholde, it shall come downe vpon Idumea, and
vpon the people of my curse to iudgement.</ab>
<ab n="6">The sword of the
Lord is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatnesse, and with
the blood of lambes and goates, with the fat of the kidneys of
rammes: for the Lord hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great
slaughter in the land of Idumea.</ab>
<ab n="7">And the Unicornes
shall come downe with them, and the bullockes with the bulles, and
their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with
fatnesse.<note> Or, Rhinocerots. , Or, drunken.</note></ab>

<fw>Gods word sure.</fw>

of the Lords vengeance, and the yeere of recompences for the
controuersie of Zion.<note> Chap. 63. 4.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">And the streames
thereof shalbe turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into
brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.</ab>
<ab n="10">It shal not be
quenched night nor day, the smoke thereof shall goe vp for euer:
from generation to generation it shall lye waste, none shal passe
through it for euer and euer.<note> Reue. 18. 2,18. and 19.3.</note></ab>
<ab n="11">¶ The
cormorant and the bitterne shall possesse it, the owle also and the
rauen shall dwell in it, and he shall stretch out vpon it the line
of confusion, and the stones of emptinesse.<note> Zeph.2. 14. reuel. 18.2. , Or, pellicane.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">They shall call
the nobles thereof to the kingdome, but none shall bee there, and
all her Princes shall bee nothing.</ab>
<ab n="13">And thornes shall
come vp in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses
thereof: and it shalbe an habitation of dragons, and a court for
owles.<note> Or, ostriches. Hebr. daughters of the owle.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">The wilde beasts
of the desert shall also meete with the wilde beasts of the Iland
and the satyre shall cry to his felow, the shrichowle also shall
rest there, &amp; finde for her selfe a place of rest.<note> Heb. Zijm. , Heb. Iijm. , Or, nightmonster.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">There shall the
great owle make her nest, and lay and hatch, and gather vnder her
shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, euery one with
her mate.</ab>
<ab n="16">¶ Seeke ye
out of the booke of the Lord, and reade: no one of these shall
faile, none shall want her mate: for my mouth, it hath commaunded,
and his spirit, it hath gathered them.</ab>
<ab n="17">And he hath cast
the lot for them, and his hand hath diuided it vnto them by line:
they shall possesse it for euer, from generation to generation
shall they dwell therein.</ab>
