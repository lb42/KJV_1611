<head>1 Ezekiel in a vision of God, at
Ierusalem, 5 is shewed the image of Ielousie. 7 The chambers of
Imagery. 13 The mourners for Tammuz, 15 the worshippers towards the

<ab n="1">And it came to
passe in the sixt yeere, in the sixt moneth, in the fift day of the
month, as I sate in mine house, and the elders of Iudah sate before
me; that the hand of the Lord God fell there vpon me.</ab>

<fw>Vile idolatrie.</fw>
<ab n="2">Then I beheld, and
loe, a likenesse as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of
his loines euen downeward, fire: and from his loines euen vpward,
as the appearance of brightnesse, as the colour of amber.</ab>
<ab n="3">And he put forth
the forme of an hand, and tooke me by a locke of mine head, and the
spirit lift me vp betweene the earth and the heauen, and brought me
in the visions of God to Ierusalem, to the doore of the inner gate,
that looketh toward the North, where was the seate of the image of
ielousie, which prouoketh to ielousie.<note> Dan.5.5.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">And behold, the
glory of the God of Israel was there according to the vision that I
saw in the plaine.<note> Chap.1. 23.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">¶ Then said
he vnto me, Sonne of man, lift vp thine eyes now the way towards
the North: so I lift vp mine eyes the way toward the North, and
behold, Northward at the gate of the altar, this image of ielousie
in the entry.</ab>
<ab n="6">He said
furthermore vnto me, Sonne of man, seest thou what they doe? euen
the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth heere,
that I should goe farre off from my sanctuarie? but turne thee yet
againe, and thou shalt see greater abominations.</ab>
<ab n="7">¶ And hee
brought me to the doore of the court, and when I looked, behold a
hole in the wall.</ab>
<ab n="8">Then said he vnto
me, Sonne of man, digge now in the wall: and when I had digged in
the wall, behold a doore.</ab>
<ab n="9">And he said vnto
me, Goe in, and behold the wicked abominations that they doe
heere.</ab>
<ab n="10">So I went in and
saw, and behold euery forme of creeping things, and abominable
beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel purtrayed vpon the
wall round about.</ab>
<ab n="11">And there stood
before them seuentie men of the ancients of the house of Israel,
and in the middest of them stood Iaazaniah the sonne of Shaphan,
with euery man his censer in his hand, and a thicke cloud of
incense went vp.</ab>
<ab n="12">Then said he vnto
me, Sonne of man, hast thou seene what the ancients of the house of
Israel doe in the darke, euery man in the chambers of his imagery?
for they say, The Lord seeth vs not, the Lord hath forsaken the
earth.<note> Chap.9.9.</note></ab>

<fw>Vile idolatrie.</fw>
<ab n="13">¶ Hee said
also vnto me, Turne thee yet againe, and thou shalt see greater
abominations that they doe.</ab>
<ab n="14">Then he brought
me to the doore of the gate of the Lords house which was towards
the North, and behold, there sate women weeping for Tammuz.</ab>
<ab n="15">¶ Then said
hee vnto me, Hast thou seene this, O sonne of man? Turne thee yet
againe, and thou shalt see greater abominations then these.</ab>
<ab n="16">And he brought me
into the inner court of the Lords house, and behold at the doore of
the Temple of the Lord, betweene the porch and the altar, were
about fiue and twentie men, with their backes toward the temple of
the Lord, and their faces towards the East, and they worshipped the
sunne towards the East.</ab>
<ab n="17">¶ Then he
said vnto me, Hast thou seene this, O sonne of man? Is it a light
thing to the house of Iudah, that they commit the abominations,
which they commit heere? for they haue filled the land with
violence, and haue returned to prouoke me to anger: and loe, they
put the branch to their nose.<note> Or is there any thing lighter than to commit?</note></ab>
<ab n="18">Therefore will I
also deale in furie: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I haue
pitie: and though they crie in mine eares with a loud voyce, yet
will I not heare them.<note> Chap.5. 11. and 7.4. , Pro.1.28. isa. 1.15. ier. 11.11. mich. 7.4.</note></ab>
