<head>CHAP.
XVII.</head>
<head>1 Vnder the parable of two Eagles
and a Vine, 11 is shewed Gods iudgement vpon Ierusalem for
reuolting from Babylon to Egypt. 22 God promiseth to plant the
Cedar of the Gospel.</head>

<ab n="1">And the word of
the Lord came vnto mee, saying,</ab>
<ab n="2">Sonne of man, put
foorth a riddle, and speake a parable vnto the house of
Israel,</ab>
<ab n="3">And say, Thus
saith the Lord God, A great eagle with great wings, long wing'd,
full of feathers, which had diuers colours, camevnto Lebanon, and
tooke the highest branch of the Cedar.<note> Hebr. embroydering.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">Hee cropt off the
top of his yong twigs, and caried it into a land of traffique; he
set it in a city of merchants.</ab>
<ab n="5">Hee tooke also of
the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitfull field, he
placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow tree.<note> Hebr. put it in a field of seed.</note></ab>
<ab n="6">And it grew, and
became a spreading Uine of low stature, whose branches turned
toward him, and the roots thereof were vnder him: so it became a
Uine, and brought forth branches, and shot foorth sprigges.</ab>
<ab n="7">There was also an
other great eagle, with great wings and many feathers, and behold,
this Uine did bend her rootes towards him, and shot forth her
branches toward him, that hee might water it by the furrowes of her
plantation.</ab>
<ab n="8">It was planted in
a good soile by great waters, that it might bring forth branches,
and that it might beare fruit, that it might be a goodly
Uine.<note> Hebr. field.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">Say thou, Thus
saith the Lord God; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull vp the
rootes thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? it
shall wither in all the leaues of her spring, euen without great
power, or many people to plucke it vp by the rootes
thereof.</ab>
<ab n="10">Yea behold,
being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not vtterly wither, when
the East wind toucheth it? it shal wither in the furrowes where it
grew.</ab>

<fw>Breach of oath.</fw>
<ab n="11">¶ Moreouer
the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,</ab>
<ab n="12">Say now to the
rebellious house, Know ye not what these things meane? tell them,
behold, the king of Babylon is come to Ierusalem, and hath taken
the King thereof, and the Princes thereof, and ledde them with him
to Babylon,</ab>
<ab n="13">And hath taken
of the kings seed, and made a couenant with him, and hath taken an
oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land,<note> Hebr. brought him to an oath.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">That the
kingdome might bee base, that it might not lift it selfe vp, but
that by keeping of his Couenant it might stand.<note> Hebr. to keepe his couenant to stand to it.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">But he rebelled
against him in sending his ambassadours into Egypt, that they might
giue him horses and much people: shall he prosper? shall he escape
that doeth such things? or shall hee breake the Couenant, and bee
deliuered?</ab>
<ab n="16">As I liue, saith
the Lord God, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made
him king, whose oath he despised, and whose couenant he brake, euen
with him, in the midst of Babylon he shall die.</ab>
<ab n="17">Neither shall
Pharaoh with his mightie armie and great companie make for him in
the warre by casting vp mounts, and building forts, to cut off many
persons.</ab>
<ab n="18">Seeing hee
despised the oath by breaking the couenant (when loe, he had giuen
his hand) and hath done all these things, he shall not
escape.</ab>
<ab n="19">Therefore thus
saith the Lord God, As I liue, surely mine oath that he hath
despised, and my Couenant that he hath broken, euen it will I
recompense vpon his owne head.</ab>
<ab n="20">And I will
spread my net vpon him, &amp; he shalbe taken in my snare, and I
will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his
trespasse, that he hath trespassed against me.<note> Chap.12. 13. and 32. 3.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">And all his
fugitiues, with all his bands, shall fall by the sword, and they
that remaine shalbe scattered towards all windes: and ye shall know
that I the Lord haue spoken it.</ab>

<fw>Gods iustice in punishing.</fw>
<ab n="22">¶ Thus
saith the Lord God, I wil also take of the highest branch of the
high Cedar, and will set it, I will croppe off from the top of his
yong twigges a tender one, and will plant it vpon an high mountaine
and eminent.</ab>
<ab n="23">In the mountaine
of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring foorth
boughes, and beare fruite, and be a goodly Cedar, and vnder it
shall dwell all foule of euery wing: in the shadow of the branches
thereof shal they dwell.</ab>
<ab n="24">And all the
trees of the field shall know that I the Lord haue brought downe
the high tree, haue exalted the low tree, haue dried vp the greene
tree, and haue made the drie tree to flourish: I the Lord haue
spoken, and haue done it.</ab>
