<head>CHAP. IV.</head>
<head>1 The rest of Christians is attained
by faith. 12 The power of Gods word. 14 By our High Priest Iesus
the sonne of God, subiect to infirmities, but not sinne, 16 wee
must and may go boldly to the throne of grace.</head>

<ab n="1">Let vs therefore
feare, lest a promise being left vs, of entring into his rest, any
of you should seeme to come short of it.</ab>
<ab n="2">For vnto vs was
the Gospel preached, as well as vnto thÄ“: but the word
preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them
that heard it.<note> Gr. the word of hearing. , Or, because they were not vnited by faith to.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">For we which haue
beleeued do enter into rest, as hee said, As I haue sworne in my
wrath, if they shall enter into my rest, although the works were
finished from the foundation of the world.</ab>
<ab n="4">For he spake in a
certaine place of the seuenth day on this wise: And God did rest
the seuenth day from all his works.</ab>
<ab n="5">And in this place
againe: If they shall enter into my rest.</ab>
<ab n="6">Seeing therfore it
remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was
first preached, entred not in because of vnbeleefe:<note> Or, the Gospel was first preached.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">Againe, hee
limiteth a certaine day, saying in Dauid, To day, after so long a
time; as it is saide, To day if ye will heare his voyce, harden not
your hearts.</ab>

<fw>Gods word.</fw>
<ab n="8">For if Iesus had
giuen them rest, then would he not afterward haue spoken of another
day.<note> That is, Iosuah.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">There remaineth
therefore a rest to the people of God.<note> Or, keeping of a Sabbath</note></ab>
<ab n="10">For he that is
entred into his rest, hee also hath ceased from his owne works, as
God did from his.</ab>
<ab n="11">Let vs labour
therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same
example of vnbeleefe.<note> Or, disobedience.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">For the word of
God is quicke and powerfull, and sharper then any two edged sword,
pearcing euen to the diuiding asunder of soule and spirit, and of
the ioynts and marrowe, and is a discerner of the thoughts and
intents of the heart.</ab>
<ab n="13">Neither is there
any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are
naked, and opened vnto the eyes of him with whome wee haue to
doe.</ab>
<ab n="14">Seeing then that
wee haue a great high Priest, that is passed into the heauens,
Iesus the Sonne of God, let vs hold fast our profession.</ab>
<ab n="15">For wee haue not
an high Priest which cannot bee touched with the feeling of our
infirmities: but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet
without sinne.</ab>
<ab n="16">Let vs therefore
come boldly vnto the throne of grace, that wee may obtaine mercy,
and finde grace to helpe in time of need.</ab>
