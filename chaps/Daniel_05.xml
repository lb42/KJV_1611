the commendation of the Queene, Daniel is brought. 17 He reprouing
the king of pride and idolatry, 25 readeth and interpreteth the
writing. 30 The Monarchie is translated to the Medes.</head>

<ab n="1">Belshazzar
the King made a great feast to a thousand of his Lords, and dranke
wine before the thousand.</ab>
<ab n="2">Belshazzar,
whiles he tasted the wine, commaunded to bring the golden and
siluer vessels, which his father Nebuchad-nezzar had taken out of
the temple which was in Ierusalem, that the king and his princes,
his wiues, and his concubines might drinke therein.<note> Cald. brought foorth.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">Then they
brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the
house of God, which was at Ierusalem, and the king and his princes,
his wiues, and his concubines dranke in them.</ab>
<ab n="4">They drunke
wine, and praised the gods of gold and of siluer, of brasse, of
yron, of wood, and of stone.</ab>
<ab n="5">¶ In the
same houre came forth fingers of a mans hand, and wrote ouer
against the candlesticke vpon the plaister of the wall of the Kings
palace, and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.</ab>

<fw>Daniel required to interprete
it.</fw>
<ab n="6">Then the
kings countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so
that the ioints of his loines were loosed, and his knees smote one
against another.<note> Cald. brightnesses. , Cald. changed it. , Or, girdles. Cald. bindings or knots.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">The king
cried aloud to bring in the Astrologers, the Caldeans, and the
soothsayers: and the king spake and said to the wise men of
Babylon, Whosoeuer shall reade this writing, and shewe me the
interpretation thereof, shall bee clothed with scarlet, and haue a
chaine of gold about his necke, and shall be the third ruler in the
kingdome.<note> Calde. with might. , Or, purple.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">Then came in
all the kings wise men, but they could not reade the writing, nor
make knowen to the king the interpretation thereof.</ab>
<ab n="9">Then was King
Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in
him, and his lordes were astonied.<note> Calde. brightnesse.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">¶ Now the
queene, by reason of the wordes of the king and his lords, came
into the banquet house, and the queene spake and said, O king, liue
for euer: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy
countenance be changed.</ab>
<ab n="11">There is a man in
thy kingdom, in whome is the spirit of the holy gods, and in the
dayes of thy father light and vnderstanding and wisedome like the
wisedome of the gods, was found in him: whom the king
Nebuchad-nezzar thy father, the king, Isay, thy father made master
of the magicians, astrologers, Caldeans, and
soothsayers,<note> Cha.2.48 , Or, grandfather. , Or, grandfather. , Cha. 4. 6.</note></ab>
<ab n="12">Forasmuch as an
excellent spirit and knowledge and vnderstanding, interpreting of
dreames, and shewing of hard sentences, &amp; dissoluing of doubts
were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar:
now let Daniel be called, and he will shewe the
interpretation.<note> Or, of an interpreter, &amp;c. , Or, of a dissoluer. , Calde. knots.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">Then was Daniel
brought in before the king, and the king spake and said vnto
Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the
captiuity of Iudah, whom the king my father brought out of
Iewrie?<note> Or, grandfather.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">I haue euen heard
of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light,
and vnderstanding, and excellent wisedome is found in thee.</ab>
<ab n="15">And now the wise
men, the astrologers haue bene brought in before me, that they
should reade this writing, and make knowen vnto me the
interpretation thereof: but they could not shewe the interpretation
of the thing.</ab>

<fw>Daniel required to interprete
it.</fw>
<ab n="16">And I haue heard
of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolue doubts:
now if thou canst read the writing, and make knowen to mee the
interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, &amp;
haue a chaine of gold about thy necke, and shalt bee the third
ruler in the kingdome.<note> Calde. interprete.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">¶ Then Daniel
answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thy selfe,
and giue thy rewards to an other, yet I will reade the writing vnto
the king, and make knowen to him the interpretation.<note> Or, fee, as chap.2.6.</note></ab>
<ab n="18">O thou king, the
most high God gaue Nebuchad-nezzar thy father a kingdome, and
maiestie, and glory, and honour.</ab>
<ab n="19">And for the
maiestie that hee gaue him, all people, nations, and languages
trembled and feared before him: whom he would, he slew, &amp; whom
he would, he kept aliue, and whom he would hee set vp, and whom he
would hee put downe.</ab>
<ab n="20">But when his heart
was lifted vp, and his minde hardened in pride: hee was deposed
from his kingly throne, and they tooke his glory from
him.<note> Or, to deale proudly. , Cal. made to come downe.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">And hee was driuen
from the sonnes of men, and his heart was made like the beasts, and
his dwelling was with the wilde asses: they fed him with grasse
like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heauen, till hee
knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdome of men, and that
hee appointeth ouer it whomsoeuer he will.<note> Cha.4.22 , Or, hee made his heart equall, &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">And thou his
sonne, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou
knewest all this:</ab>
<ab n="23">But hast lifted vp
thy selfe against the Lord of heauen, and they haue brought the
vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy wiues
and thy concubines haue drunke wine in them, and thou hast praised
the gods of siluer, and golde, of brasse, yron, wood and stone,
which see not, nor heare, nor knowe: and the God in whose hande thy
breath is, and whose are all thy wayes, hast thou not
glorified.</ab>
<ab n="24">Then was the part
of the hand sent from him, and this writing was written.</ab>
<ab n="25">¶ And this is
the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL VPHARSIN.</ab>

<fw>Belshazzar slaine.</fw>
<ab n="26">This is the
interpretation of the thing, MENE, God hath numbred thy kingdome,
and finished it.</ab>
<ab n="27">TEKEL, thou art
weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.</ab>
<ab n="28">PERES, thy
kingdome is diuided, and giuen to the Medes and Persians.</ab>
<ab n="29">Then commanded
Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chaine
of gold about his necke, and made a Proclamation concerning him,
that he should be the third ruler in the kingdome.</ab>
<ab n="30">¶ In that
night was Belshazzar the king of the Caldeans slaine.</ab>
<ab n="31">And Darius the
Median tooke the kingdome, being about threescore and two yeere
old.<note> Cald. he as the Sonne of, &amp;c. , Or, now.</note></ab>
