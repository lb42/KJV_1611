<head>CHAP. I.</head>
<head>1 He describeth the person of
Christ, in whome we haue eternal life, by a cōmunion with God:
5 to which we must adioine holinesse of life, to testifie the
trueth of that our communion and profession of faith, as also to
assure vs of the forgiuenesse of our sinnes by Christs
death.</head>

<ab n="1">That which
was from þe beginning, which wee haue heard, which
wee haue seene with our eyes, which wee haue looked vpon, and our
hands haue handled of the word of life.</ab>
<ab n="2">(For the life
was manifested, and we haue seene it, and beare witnes, and shew
vnto you that eternall life which was with the Father, and was
manifested vnto vs.)</ab>
<ab n="3">That which
wee haue seene and heard, declare we vnto you, that ye also may
haue felowship with vs; and truely our fellowship is with the
Father, and with his Sonne Iesus Christ.</ab>
<ab n="4">And these
things write we vnto you, that your ioy may be full.</ab>
<ab n="5">This then is
the message which we haue heard of him, and declare vnto you, that
God is light, and in him is no darkenesse at all.</ab>
<ab n="6">If we say
that we haue felowship with him, and walke in darkenesse, we lie,
and doe not the trueth.</ab>
<ab n="7">But if wee
walke in the light, as he is in the light, wee haue fellowship one
with another, and the blood of Iesus Christ his Sonne clenseth vs
from all sinne.</ab>
<ab n="8">If we say
that we haue no sinne, we deceiue our selues, and the trueth is not
in vs.</ab>

<fw>Our Aduocate.</fw>
<ab n="9">If we
confesse our sinnes, hee is faithfull, &amp; iust to forgiue vs our
sinnes, and to cleanse vs from all vnrighteousnesse.</ab>
<ab n="10">If we say that we
haue not sinned, wee make him a liar, and his word is not in
vs.</ab>
