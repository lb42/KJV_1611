<head>CHAP. IX.</head>
<head>2 Christ curing one sicke of the
palsey, 9 calleth Matthew from the receite of custome, 10 eateth
with Publicanes, and sinners, 14 defendeth his Disciples for not
fasting, 20 cureth the bloody issue, 23 raiseth from death Iairus
daughter, 27 giueth sight to two blind men, 32 healeth a dumbe man
possessed of a deuil, 36 and hath compassion of the
multitude.</head>

<ab n="1">And hee entred
into a ship, and passed ouer, and came into his owne citie.</ab>
<ab n="2">And behold, they
brought to him a man sicke of the palsie, lying on a bed: and Iesus
seeing their faith, said vnto the sicke of the palsie, Sonne, be of
good cheere, thy sinnes be forgiuen thee.<note> Marke 2.3 luke 5.18.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">And behold,
certaine of the Scribes said within themselues, This man
blasphemeth.</ab>
<ab n="4">And Iesus knowing
their thoughts, said, Wherefore thinke yee euill in your
hearts?</ab>
<ab n="5">For whether is
easier to say, Thy sinnes be forgiuen thee: or to say, Arise, and
walke?</ab>
<ab n="6">But that yee may
know that the sonne of man hath power on earth to forgiue sinnes,
(Then saith hee to the sicke of the palsie) Arise, take vp thy bed,
and goe vnto thine house.</ab>
<ab n="7">And he arose, and
departed to his house.</ab>
<ab n="8">But when the
multitudes saw it, they marueiled, &amp; glorified God, which had
giuen such power vnto men.</ab>
<ab n="9">¶ And as
Iesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man named Matthew, sitting
at the receite of custome: and he saith vnto him, Follow me. And he
arose and followed him.<note> Marke 2.14. luke 5.27.</note></ab>
<ab n="10">¶ And it
came to passe, as Iesus sate at meate in the house, behold, many
publicanes and sinners, came and sate downe with him and his
Disciples.</ab>
<ab n="11">And when the
Pharisees saw it, they said vnto his disciples, Why eateth your
master with publicanes &amp; sinners.</ab>
<ab n="12">But when Iesus
heard that, hee said vnto them, They that be whole neede not a
Physicion, but they that are sicke.</ab>

<fw>The blinde and dumbe, healed.</fw>
<ab n="13">But goe ye and
learne what that meaneth, I will haue mercy and not sacrifice: for
I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance.<note> Ose.6.6. chap.12.7. , 1.Tim.1.15.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">¶ Then came
to him the disciples of Iohn, saying, Why doe we and the Pharisees
fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?<note> Mar.2.18. luke 5.33.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">And Iesus saide
vnto them, Can the children of the bride-chamber mourne, as long as
the bridegrome is with them? But the dayes will come when the
bridegrome shall bee taken from them, and then shall they
fast.</ab>
<ab n="16">No man putteth a
piece of new cloth vnto an olde garment: for that which is put in
to fill it vp, taketh from the garment, &amp; the rent is made
worse.<note> Or, raw, or vnwrought cloth.</note></ab>
<ab n="17">Neither doe men
put new wine into old bottels: else the bottels breake, and the
wine runneth out, and the bottels perish: but they put new wine
into new bottels, and both are preserued.</ab>
<ab n="18">¶ While hee
spake these things vnto them, beholde, there came a certaine ruler
and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is euen now dead: but come,
and lay thy hand vpon her, and she shall liue.<note> Mar.5.22. luke 8.41.</note></ab>
<ab n="19">And Iesus arose,
and followed him, and so did his disciples.</ab>
<ab n="20">(¶ And
behold, a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood twelue
yeeres, came behinde him, and touched the hemme of his
garment.</ab>
<ab n="21">For she said
within her selfe, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be
whole.</ab>
<ab n="22">But Iesus turned
him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, bee of good
comfort, thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made
whole from that houre.)</ab>
<ab n="23">And when Iesus
came into the rulers house, and saw the minstrels and the people
making a noise,</ab>
<ab n="24">He said vnto
them, Giue place, for the mayd is not dead, but sleepeth. And they
laughed him to scorne.</ab>
<ab n="25">But when the
people were put foorth, he went in, and tooke her by the hand: and
the mayd arose.</ab>
<ab n="26">And the fame
hereof went abroad into all that land.<note> Or, this fame.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">¶ And when
Iesus departed thence, two blinde men followed him, crying, and
saying, Thou sonne of Dauid, haue mercy on vs.</ab>

<fw>The blinde and dumbe, healed.</fw>
<ab n="28">And when he was
come into the house, the blinde men came to him: and Iesus saith
vnto them, Beleeue ye that I am able to doe this? They said vnto
him, Yea, Lord.</ab>
<ab n="29">Then touched he
their eyes, saying, According to your faith, bee it vnto
you.</ab>
<ab n="30">And their eyes
were opened: and Iesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no
man know it.</ab>
<ab n="31">But they, when
they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that
countrey.</ab>
<ab n="32">¶ As they
went out, beholde, they brought to him a dumbe man possessed with a
deuill.<note> Luke 11.14.</note></ab>
<ab n="33">And when the
deuil was cast out, the dumbe spake, and the multitudes marueiled,
saying, It was neuer so seene in Israel.</ab>
<ab n="34">But the Pharisees
said, He casteth out the deuils through the prince of the
deuils.<note> Chap.12.24. marke 3.22. luke 11.15.</note></ab>
<ab n="35">And Iesus went
about all the cities and villages, teaching in their Synagogues,
and preaching the Gospel of the kingdome, and healing euery
sickenesse, and euery disease among the people.<note> Mar.6.6. luke 13.22.</note></ab>
<ab n="36">¶ But when
he saw the multitudes, he was moued with compassion on them,
because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheepe hauing
no shepheard.<note> Mar.6.34. , Or, were tyred and lay downe. , Num.27.17.</note></ab>
<ab n="37">Then saith he
vnto his disciples, The haruest truely is plenteous, but the
labourers are few.<note> Luke 10.2.</note></ab>
<ab n="38">Pray ye therefore
the Lord of the haruest, that hee will send foorth labourers into
his haruest.</ab>
