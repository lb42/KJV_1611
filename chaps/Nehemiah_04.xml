<head>CHAP. IV.</head>
<head>1 While the enemies scoffe, Nehemiah
prayeth and continueth the worke. 7 Vnderstanding the wrath and
secrets of the enemy, hee setteth a watch. 13 Hee armeth the
labourers, 19 and giueth military precepts.</head>

<ab n="1">But it came to
passe, that when Sanballat heard, that we builded the wall, he was
wroth, and tooke great indignation, and mocked the Iewes.</ab>
<ab n="2">And he spake
before his brethren, and the army of Samaria, and said, What doe
these feeble Iewes? wil they fortifie themselues? will they
sacrifice? wil they make an end in a day? wil they reuiue the
stones, out of the heapes of the rubbish, which are
burnt?<note> Hebr. leaue to themselues.</note></ab>
<ab n="3">Now Tobiah the
Ammonite was by him, and he said, Euen that which they build, if a
foxe goe vp, he shall euen breake downe their stone wall.</ab>
<ab n="4">Heare, O our God,
for we are despised: and turne their reproch vpon their owne head,
and giue them for a pray, in the land of captiuitie.<note> Hebr. despight.</note></ab>
<ab n="5">And couer not
their iniquitie, and let not their sinne bee blotted out from
before thee: for they haue prouoked thee to anger before the
builders.</ab>
<ab n="6">So built we the
wall, and all the wall was ioyned together vnto the halfe therof:
for the people had a minde to worke.</ab>

<fw>The builders with weapons.</fw>
<ab n="7">¶ But it
came to passe that when Sanballat and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and
the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walles of
Ierusalem were made vp, and that the breaches began to bee stopped,
then they were very wroth,<note> Hebr. ascended.</note></ab>
<ab n="8">And conspired all
of them together, to come and to fight against Ierusalem, and to
hinder it.<note> Hebr. to make an errour to it.</note></ab>
<ab n="9">Neuertheles, we
made our prayer vnto our God, and set a watch against them, day and
night, because of them.</ab>
<ab n="10">And Iudah said,
The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is
much rubbish, so that we are not able to build the wall.</ab>
<ab n="11">And our
aduersaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till wee come
in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the worke to
cease.</ab>
<ab n="12">And it came to
passe that when the Iewes which dwelt by them, came, they said vnto
vs ten time, From all places, whence yee shall returne vnto vs,
they will be vpon you.<note> Or, that from all places ye must returne to vs.</note></ab>
<ab n="13">¶ Therefore
set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher
places, I euen set the people, after their families, with their
swords, their speares, and their bowes.<note> Heb. from the lower parts of the place, &amp;c.</note></ab>
<ab n="14">And I looked,
and rose vp, and said vnto the Nobles, and to the rulers, and to
rest of the people, Bee not ye afraid of them: Remember the Lord
which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your
sonnes and your daughters, your wiues &amp; your houses.</ab>
<ab n="15">And it came to
passe when our enemies heard that it was knowen vnto vs, and God
had brought their counsell to nought, that we returned all of vs to
the wall, euery one vnto his worke.</ab>
<ab n="16">And it came to
passe from that time forth, that the halfe of my seruants wrought
in the worke, and the other halfe of them held both the speares,
the shields and the bowes, and the habergeons, and the rulers were
behind all the house of Iudah.</ab>
<ab n="17">They which
builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that
laded, euery one with one of his hands wrought in the worke, and
with the other hand held a weapon.</ab>
<ab n="18">For the
builders, euery one had his sword girded by his side, and so
builded: and he that sounded the trumpet was by mee.<note> Heb. on his loynes.</note></ab>

<fw>The builders with weapons.</fw>
<ab n="19">¶ And I
said vnto the Nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the
people, The worke is great and large, and wee are separated vpon
the wall, one farre from another:</ab>
<ab n="20">In what place
therefore ye heare the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither vnto
vs: our God shal fight for vs.</ab>
<ab n="21">So wee laboured
in the worke: and halfe of them held the speares, from the rising
of the morning, til the starres appeared.</ab>
<ab n="22">Likewise at the
same time said I vnto the people, Let euery one, with his seruant,
lodge within Ierusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to
vs, and labour on the day.</ab>
<ab n="23">So neither I,
nor my brethren, nor my seruants, nor the men of the guard which
followed me, none of vs put off our clothes, sauing that euery one
put them off for washing.<note> Or, euery one went with his weapon for water.</note></ab>
