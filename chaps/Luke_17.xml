22 Of the kingdome of God, and the comming of the Sonne of
man.</head>

<ab n="1">Then said he
vnto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come,
but wo vnto him through whom they come.<note> Mat. 18. 7.</note></ab>
<ab n="2">It were better
for him that a milstone were hanged about his necke, and he cast
into the Sea, then that he should offend one of these little
ones.</ab>
<ab n="3">¶ Take
heed to your selues: If thy brother trespasse against thee, rebuke
him, and if he repent, forgiue him.<note> Mat. 18. 21.</note></ab>
<ab n="4">And if hee
trespasse against thee seuen times in a day, and seuen times in a
day turne againe to thee, saying, I repent, thou shalt forgiue
him.</ab>
<ab n="5">And the
Apostles said vnto the Lord, Increase our faith.</ab>
<ab n="6">And the Lord
said, If yee had faith as a graine of mustard seede, yee might say
vnto this Sycamine tree, Be thou plucked vp by the root, and be
thou planted in the sea, &amp; it should obey you.<note> Mat. 17. 20.</note></ab>
<ab n="7">But which of
you hauing a seruant plowing, or feeding cattell, will say vnto him
by &amp; by when he is come from the field, Goe and sit downe to
meate?</ab>
<ab n="8">And will not
rather say vnto him, Make ready wherewith I may suppe, and gird thy
selfe, and serue me, till I haue eaten and drunken: and afterward
thou shalt eate and drinke.</ab>
<ab n="9">Doeth he
thanke that seruant, because hee did the things that were commanded
him? I trow not.</ab>
<ab n="10">So likewise ye,
when ye shal haue done all those things which are commanded you,
say, Wee are vnprofitable seruants: Wee haue done that which was
our duety to doe.</ab>

<fw>Ten lepers clensed.</fw>
<ab n="11">¶ And it came
to passe, as he went to Hierusalem, that hee passed thorow the mids
of Samaria and Galile.</ab>
<ab n="12">And as he entred
into a certaine village, there met him tenne men that were lepers,
which stood afarre off.</ab>
<ab n="13">And they lifted vp
their voices, and said, Iesus master haue mercy on vs.</ab>
<ab n="14">And when he saw
them, hee said vnto them, Goe shew your selues vnto the Priests.
And it came to passe, that as they went, they were
cleansed.<note> Leu.14.2.</note></ab>
<ab n="15">And one of them
when hee sawe that he was healed, turned backe, and with a loud
voice glorified God,</ab>
<ab n="16">And fell downe on
his face at his feet, giuing him thanks: and he was a
Samaritane.</ab>
<ab n="17">And Iesus
answering, said, Were there not ten cleansed, but where are the
nine?</ab>
<ab n="18">There are not found
that returned to giue glory to God, saue this stranger.</ab>
<ab n="19">And he said vnto
him, Arise, go thy way, thy faith hath made thee whole.</ab>
<ab n="20">¶ And when hee
was demanded of the Pharises, when the kingdome of God should come,
hee answered them, and said, The kingdome of God commeth not with
obseruation.<note> Or, with outward shew.</note></ab>
<ab n="21">Neither shall they
say, Loe here, or loe there: for behold, the kingdome of God is
within you.<note> Or, among you.</note></ab>
<ab n="22">And hee said vnto
the disciples, The dayes will come, when ye shall desire to see one
of the dayes of the Sonne of man, and ye shall not see it.</ab>
<ab n="23">And they shall say
to you, See here, or see there: Goe not after them, nor follow
them.<note> Mat. 24. 23.</note></ab>
<ab n="24">For as the
lightning that lighteneth out of the one part vnder heauen, shineth
vnto the other part vnder heauen: so shall also the Sonne of man be
in his day.</ab>
<ab n="25">But first must hee
suffer many things, &amp; be reiected of this generation.</ab>
<ab n="26">And as it was in
the dayes of Noe: so shal it be also in the dayes of the Sonne of
man.<note> Gen. 7.</note></ab>
<ab n="27">They did eate, they
dranke, they married wiues, they were giuen in mariage, vntill the
day that Noe entred into the arke: and the flood came, and
destroyed them all.</ab>
<ab n="28">Likewise also as it
was in the dayes of Lot, they did eat, they dranke, they bought,
they sold, they planted, they builded:<note> Gen. 19.</note></ab>

<fw>An vniust iudge.</fw>
<ab n="29">But the same day
that Lot went out of Sodome, it rained fire and brimstone from
heauen, &amp; destroyed them all:</ab>
<ab n="30">Euen thus shall it
bee in the day when the Sonne of man is reuealed.</ab>
<ab n="31">In that day he
which shall be vpon the house top, and his stuffe in the house, let
him not come downe to take it away: and he that is in the field,
let him likewise not returne backe.</ab>
<ab n="32">Remember Lots
wife.<note> Gen.19. 26.</note></ab>
<ab n="33">Whosoeuer shall
seeke to saue his life, shall lose it, and whosoeuer shall lose his
life, shall preserue it.<note> Mat.16.25</note></ab>
<ab n="34">I tell you, in that
night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shal be taken, the
other shall be left.<note> Mat.24.40</note></ab>
<ab n="35">Two women shall bee
grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other
left.</ab>
<ab n="36">Two men shall be in
the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.<note> This 36. verse is wanting in most of the Greek copies.</note></ab>
<ab n="37">And they answered,
and said vnto him, Where, Lord? And he said vnto them, Wheresoeuer
the body is, thither will the Eagles be gathered
together.<note> Mat.24 28</note></ab>
